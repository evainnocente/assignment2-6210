45225150,6204,Cystophora cristata,Vulnerable,A3c,2016,2015-06-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Although there is no reliable, current estimate for Hooded Seal abundance, the population is thought to be relatively large, numbering some few hundreds of thousands. The West Ice stock has been surveyed four times in the last 15 years, most recently in 2012, and it has been declining at a rate of 3.7%/year. The stock in Canadian waters increased during the 1980s and 1990s but the rate of increase was declining over time and with no surveys since 2005 there is no way to know the recent or current trend. However, with changing sea ice conditions reducing the pack ice habitat needed by all Hooded Seals for pupping and molting, there is good reason to believe that numbers in all stocks might be declining. Assuming that the entire population will decline at 3.7%/year (which is the West Ice rate of decline currently), the three generation reduction would be 75% which qualifies Hooded Seals for listing as Endangered under criterion A3c. Even if the overall rate of decline were only 1%/year the three generation decline would be 32%, which would qualify Hooded Seals as being Vulnerable. Given that the population is still relatively large, and there are uncertainties about the rate of future decline we opt for the more modest listing of Vulnerable under criterion A3c for Hooded Seals at this time.","Hooded Seals are a sexually dimorphic ice-breeding pinniped. Adult males average 2.5 m in length and weigh 300 kg (Kovacs and Lavigne 1986), with large animals reaching over 400 kg (Kovacs 2002). Adult females are smaller, averaging 2.2 m and 160 kg, but can reach 300 kg. Pups are born at approximately 1 m in length and 24 kg (Kovacs and Lavigne 1992).Hooded Seals pup on pack ice late in the spring season, when the pack is already breaking up. The breeding season for this polygynous species is very short, usually lasting only about 2.5 weeks. Males attend a single female and her pup at a time, sequentially re-establishing with a new female if the male is competitively successful (Kovacs 1990). Mating takes place in the water (Boness et al. 1988). Hooded Seals have the shortest lactation period of any mammal, with most pups nursing for only four days (Bowen et al. 1985). Pups weigh an average of 48 kg at weaning, and on average double their birth mass in the short nursing period (Kovacs and Lavigne 1992, Lydersen et al. 1997). The short reproductive period is energetically advantageous to both males and females, with relative losses in body mass being small for both sexes compared to other phocid Seals (Kovacs and Lavigne 1992, Kovacs et al. 1996, Lydersen and Kovacs 1999).Hooded Seals moult in July, with each breeding stock congregating on sea ice north of their respective whelping areas. If mixing does occur, the degree to which it takes place is unknown. Following the moulting period they disperse in the North Atlantic (Folkow and Blix 1999, Folkow et al. 1996, Andersen et al. 2009, Kovacs et al. 2011a). Apart from the breeding and moulting periods when Hooded Seals form loose aggregations in specific areas, they are thought to live quite solitary lives. However, little is known about them outside those periods. Groups of females and young animals have been seen at the northern ice edge in summer, but it is not known whether the groups are socially facilitated or solely the result of concentrations of prey. Hooded Seal longevity is 25-30 years (Kovacs 2002).Hooded Seals are very capable divers that spend extensive periods at sea without hauling out (e.g., Folkow and Blix 1999, Andersen et al. 2013). Most of their dives are from 100-600 m in depth and last 5-25 minutes, however, very deep dives to over 1,000 m and dives lasting almost an hour have been recorded (Folkow et al. 1996, Lydersen et al. unpubl. data). Similar to Elephant Seals, Hooded Seals perform drift dives, in which buoyancy controls their movements through the water column (Andersen et al. 2014). Hooded Seals feed on a wide variety of fish and invertebrates, including species that occur throughout the water column (Andersen et al. 2013). Examples of typical prey are pelagic Amphipods (Parathemisto sp.), Greenland Halibut, members of the Cod family such as Polar and Atlantic Cod, Redfishes, Sand Eels, Herring, Capelin, Squid (e.g., Gonatus fabricii), and Shrimp (Haug et al. 2004, 2007).A recent study of foraging habitat selection by Hooded Seals in the Northwest Atlantic documented significantly different preferences by adult males and females with the former occupying areas with complex seabed relief while the latter concentrated their foraging search effort along shelf areas (Andersen et al. 2013). Productivity (measured as chlorophyll a) was the most important single factor influencing habitat selection across all age groups.Polar Bears and Killer Whales are known Hooded Seal predators (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). These predators are thought to be having increased impacts on Hooded Seals in the West Ice following the deterioration of breeding ice used by this species (Foote et al. 2013, Øigård et al. 2014); Greenland Sharks also take at least young Hooded Seals (Leclerc et al. 2012).","By-catch of Hooded Seals in coastal net fisheries has been reported from the USA, from trawl fisheries off Norway and Newfoundland, and from salmon drift nets used off Greenland (Woodley and Lavigne 1991, Reeves et al. 1992, Waring et al. 2005). Competition for food with commercial fisheries and other predators has been suggested as a factor that may limit population growth or lead to declines of Hooded Seals (Reijnders et al. 1993). This factor may be playing a role in the continuing decline of Hooded Seals in the Northeast Atlantic given that abundance of Redfish, which are favoured prey of Hooded Seals, has declined in the late 1990s in both the Barents and Norwegian Seas due to excessive fishing pressure. No targeted catch is allowed for some Redfish species in this region and juvenile fish are being protected to attempt to promote recovery (ICES 2013b).Impacts of oil spills on Hooded Seals have not been reported; however as an ice breeding species, they might be at risk of mortality from spills during the pupping season when newborn and newly weaned pups could be fouled (St. Aubin 1990). Hooded Seals have been exposed to Morbillivirus (Duignan et al. 1997), but are not known to have suffered fatalities during the mass die-offs of Harbour Seals in European waters from phocine distemper virus in 1998 and 2002. Subsequent testing revealed antibodies to the virus in 18-24% percent of the Hooded Seals sampled indicating exposure to the virus (Harkonen et al. 2006). Hooded Seals in the northeast Atlantic have high organohalogen contaminant burdens that are thought to be impacting thyroid homeostasis (Villanger et al. 2013).The Hooded Seal is a pack ice species, and is dependent on ice as a substrate for pupping, moulting, and resting and as such is vulnerable to reduction in extent or timing of pack ice formation and retreat (Tynan and DeMaster 1997, Johnston et al. 2005, Learmonth et al. 2006, Kovacs and Lydersen 2008, Laidre et al. 2008). The very short, intense breeding season of Hooded Seals that is timed right at the end of the sea ice season, has likely put them at heightened risk of impacts arising from changes in the duration of the sea ice season (Kovacs et al. 2011b, 2012; Stenson and Hammill 2014). The Barents Sea region’s sea ice cover is declining at twice the rate of other arctic areas with a shortening of &gt;20 weeks having taken place in the last few decades (Laidre et al. 2015), so it is not surprising that the West Ice stock is the first to be heavily impacted.The productivity of the ice-edge ecosystem is also dependent on the dynamics and seasonality of arctic ice, and alterations to the cycle of formation and retreat of the ice could be having negative effects on important Hooded Seal prey. For example, Polar cod abundance has declined markedly in the last decade in the Barents Region within a broad, rapid “borealization” of the fish community in this sector of the Arctic (Fossheim et al. 2015). Decreases in sea ice cover could also lead to more shipping and development of extraction based industries in the Arctic (gas, oil, mining, etc.) which in turn could negatively affect Hooded Seals through increased exposure to contaminants and pollution, increased disturbance, and increased risk of shipping accidents and spills (Pagnan 2000).Predation by Polar Bears is thought to be an increasing issue of concern with respect to the West Ice stock’s conservation status. Polar Bear diets have shown an increase in Hooded Seal consumption by 9.5% per decade since the mid-1980s in East Greenland along with a concomitant decrease in the consumption of Ringed Seals (McKinney et al. 2013). These changes are likely primarily due to changes in sea ice distribution and extent (but could also reflect a declining Ringed Seal population).","Hooded Seal populations are usually assessed based on aerial survey counts of pups at whelping areas in the pack ice, combined with population models to extrapolate to total population size. In Canadian waters, pup production estimates for the Front have been: 1978—26,000 (Winters and Bergflodt 1978); 1984—62,400 (Bowen et al. 1987); 1985—61,400 (Hay et al. 1985); 1990—83,100 (Hammill et al. 1992); and 2005—107,013 (Hammill and Stenson 2006). These figures indicate an increase of 5.2%/year during 1978-2005, 2.6%/year during 1984-2005, and 1.7%/year during 1990-2005. Pup production estimates for Gulf region in Canada have been: 1991—2,006 (Hammill et al. 1992); 1998/99—2,000 (ICES 2001); and 2005—6,620 (Hammill and Stenson 2006). Comparing counts in 1991 and 2005 suggests that the number of animals in the Gulf increased by 8.5%/year during that period. Only two estimates are available for Davis Strait, 19,000 pups in 1984 (Bowen et al. 1987) and 3,346 in 2005 (Hammill and Stenson 2006); this suggests a decline of 8.2%/year. Hammill and Stenson (2006, 2007) concluded that these estimates suggest a moderate increase both in pup production and population size between the mid 1980s and 2005 in the northwest Atlantic as a whole. Surveys carried out at all three whelping areas in 2005 produced an estimate of 116,900 pups born. The size of the whole population, modeled based on the pup counts, was estimated as 592,000 (Waring et al. 2007). No more recent survey information is available for the northwest Atlantic breeding areas (ICES 2013a) and the down-turn in the number of animals in the Davis Strait in the 2005 survey is concerning, especially given its magnitude and the continued high hunting levels of this species in West Greenland.Hooded Seals in the West Ice have shown, and continue to show, a declining trend. Pup production estimates have been: 1997—23,762 (ICES 2013a); 2005—15,250 (Salberg et al. 2008); 2007—16,140 (ICES 2013a); and 2012—13,655 (Øigård et al. 2014). Comparing the estimates for 1997 and 2012 indicates a population decrease of 3.7%/year and a reduction in population size of 43% in 15 years (1.2 generations using the generation time of 12.8 years calculated by Pacifici et al. 2013). The most recent estimate of the total size of this population is 82,830 (SE=8,028) and models suggest a continued decline of approximately 7% per year in the coming decade (Øigård et al. 2014). This stock is less than 10% of its abundance observed some 60 years ago (ICES 2013a). Overhunting was clearly involved in the collapse of this stock as quotas were being set for a population size much larger than it actually was. However, the cause of the significant, on-going decline in this population is thought to be related to climate change induced alternation of its sea ice breeding habitat and increased predation by Polar Bears and Killer Whales in the pupping areas (Øigard et al. 2014) but prey availability might also be an issue.Summing the most recent estimates for all stocks (three regions in the northwest Atlantic–2005; West Ice stock–2012) gives a total Hooded Seal population size estimate of approximately 675,000. However, with no recent surveys in Canada or Greenland this estimate cannot be considered reliable.Available data show clearly that the Greenland Sea population has declined in recent years. With no surveys in the past 10 years, the trend for the northwestern stocks is unknown. Pup counts at the Front increased through until 2005, but with the rate of increase declining over time. With 15 years between surveys, it is possible that the population had peaked and started to decline before 2005. Since 2005, there have been several years with bad ice conditions when few Hooded Seals were sighted on the ice and it is not known whether any successful reproduction at all took place for the Gulf segment of the population (Stenson and Hammill 2014). Given the available data, the best estimate for the current population trend for Hooded Seals is -3.7%/year.Because of their preference for heavy sea ice conditions for breeding, it is unlikely that Hooded Seals will continue to breed in their southern-most breeding areas in future. This species has been deemed one the most sensitive Arctic/subarctic marine mammal species to the impacts of climate change (Laidre et al. 2008).",Unknown,"Hooded Seals are found at high latitudes in the North Atlantic, and seasonally they extend their range north into the Arctic Ocean. They breed on pack ice and are associated with it much of the year, though they can spend significant periods of time pelagic, without hauling out (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988, Folkow and Blix 1999, Anderson et al. 2009, Folkow et al. 2010, Kovacs et al. 2011a). There are four major pupping areas: near the Magdalen Islands in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, north of Newfoundland in an area known as the Front, in central Davis Strait, and in the West Ice in the Greenland Sea near the island of Jan Mayen (Sergeant 1974). Hooded Seals sometimes wander extensively; young animals have come ashore as far south as Portugal and the Canary Islands in Europe and south into the Caribbean in the West Atlantic (Kovacs and Lavigne 1986, Rice 1998). They have also been found outside the Atlantic Region, in the North Pacific and even as far south as California (Burns and Gavin 1980, Dudley 1992, Fay 1995). Since the mid 1990s, large numbers of vagrant Hooded Seals have been found outside the Arctic in some years (Mignucci-Giannoni and Haddow 2002, Harris and Gupta 2006). Stranded Hooded Seals are increasingly common on Sable Island, Canada, and along the New England coast and in the Saint Lawrence River area, particularly in years with sparse sea ice conditions (Harris et al. 2001, Lucas and Daoust 2002, Truchon et al. 2013).","Hooded Seals were subjected to intense commercial hunting in the 19th and 20th centuries. Harvests were often conducted in association with Harp Seal harvests and commercial fisheries for Greenland Sharks. Norway, the Soviet Union (now Russia), Canada, and Greenland have all been involved in the commercial harvests of this species. Following World War II the hunt was primarily focused on pups because of their highly prized blue-back pelt, however, many adult females were taken while defending their pups until killing of mothers in the breeding areas was prohibited in the various areas (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988).The abundance estimate for Hooded Seals in the Northwest Atlantic is now a decade old; the last survey was conducted in 2005 (ICES 2013a), and the stock is now treated as a data-poor stock in terms of management protocols. Total allowable catch was set at 8,200 in 2007 and remained unchanged through to 2015 despite the lack of new information on stock sizes or trends in the region. However, Canadian catches are reported to be very low, some few 10s of animals per year.Hooded Seals are also harvested in Greenland at a current level of a few thousand animals per year. It is assumed that most of those animals are from the northwest Atlantic breeding groups (Davis Strait, Gulf, and Front) given that most of the harvest takes place in West Greenland. However, some animals are also taken on the east coast of Greenland, and these animals are likely from the West Ice stock.Hooded Seals have been harvested in the West Ice (Greenland Sea, north of Jan Mayen) for centuries. This hunt increased substantially after World War II, to levels that were clearly not sustainable. Regulatory measures were introduced in 1958 to reduce effort, and quotas were imposed in 1971 (Sergeant 1976, ICES 2006). Based on catch per unit effort analyses and mark-recapture pup production estimates it was assumed that the stock increased from the 1960s through to the 1990s at an unknown rate (Ulltang and Øien 1988). In hindsight this almost certainly was not the case (ICES 2013a). Aerial surveys in 1994 failed to produce an abundance estimate (Øritsland and Øien 1995). Recent modelling efforts suggest that a very substantial decrease in population abundance took place from the late 1940s up to the early 1980s (ICES 2006). This decline has continued through to the present and predictions suggest an ongoing decline of 7% over the coming decade (Øigård et al. 2014). Total pup production in this stock was estimated to be 24,000 in 1997 and this number dropped to 15,250 in 2005 (Salberg et al. 2008) and has continued to decline to 13,655 in 2012, despite a complete cessation of commercial harvesting (Øigård et al. 2014).",Terrestrial|Marine,"Numerous conservation measures, international management plans, harvest quotas, agreements, and treaties have been developed for the conservation of Hooded Seals dating back to the 1870s. Molting Seals in the Denmark Strait have been protected since 1961. Harvest quotas at Jan Mayen began in 1971. Hunting was banned in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 1972 and quotas were placed on the rest of the Canadian harvest beginning in 1974. A European Economic Community ban on importation on Seal products in 1985 reduced the harvest of blueback Hooded Seals through the loss of the primary market for the furs (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988, Reeves et al. 1992). Greenlandic hunting is not limited, and might be at levels that are not sustainable, given deteriorating breeding conditions. The northeast Atlantic stock has experienced close to a 90% decline and the decline is ongoing. Population information for the northwest Atlantic is a decade old, leaving trends unknown for this segment of the population.Based on population size, geographic range, habitat specificity, diet diversity, migration, site fidelity, sensitivity to changes in sea ice, sensitivity to changes in the trophic web, and maximum population growth potential Hooded Seals were rated to be among the top three arctic marine mammal species in terms of sensitivity to climate change (Laidre et al. 2008). This species should be re-evaluated as soon as new data are available for Canada and Greenland.",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45225428,8010,Erignathus barbatus,Least Concern,,2016,2016-02-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Due to its large population size, broad distribution, variable feeding habits, and no evidence of a current decline, the Bearded Seal are classified as Least Concern. However, Bearded Seals are very likely going to be negatively impacted by climate change, in particular because of losses of sea ice, and they should be monitored over the coming decades and reassessed as soon as more data become available.","Bearded Seals are the largest northern phocid seal. Burns (1981) found that the average standard length of adults measured from the Bering/Chukchi region was 233 cm, with females slightly longer and substantially heavier than males. Maximum lengths were 233 cm for males and 243 cm for females and maximum weights were 262 kg and 360 kg. Newborn pups averaged 131 cm in length. Quakenbush et al. (2011) found an average asymptotic length of 219 cm for Bering/Chukchi samples from the 1970s, and 209 cm for samples from the 2000s. Cameron et al. (2010) report a maximum weight of 432 kg for a female collected in the Bering Sea in spring 1985. The Atlantic Bearded Seal is of similar size, and shares the slight sexual dimorphism, with females tending to be larger than males (Andersen et al. 1999, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). Maximum mass recorded in Svalbard is for a female in spring that weighed 424 kg In Alaskan waters, sexual maturity is reached between 3 and 6 years in females, with an average of 4 years (Quakenbush et al. 2011). Males reach sexual maturity at 6-7 years (Burns 1981). In Svalbard, females reach sexual maturity at an age of 5 years, while males are 6 years of age when they are sexually mature though it is likely some years from that point before they compete successfully to breed (Andersen et al. 1999). Final body size in Bearded Seals is reached at approximately 9-10 years (McLaren 1958). Maximum longevity is likely 25-30 years (Cameron et al. 2010).Bearded Seal pups are normally born on pack ice or small floes of annually-formed sea ice that fracture away from shore-fast ice as it breaks up in late spring (Kovacs et al. 1996, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). They also have been documented to use glacier ice pieces floating on the sea for birthing and nursing when forced to by the lack of availability of first-year sea ice (Lydersen et al. 2014). The large, precocial pups swim within hours of birth (Kovacs 2009). Peak birthing occurs between late March and mid-May, varying somewhat across the Bearded Seal’s range (Burns 1981, Kovacs 2009). Gjertz et al. (2000) estimated that in Svalbard pups are weaned in approximately 24 days. Nursing might be somewhat shorter for the Pacific subspecies, Burns (1981) suggested that pups are weaned at 12-18 days of age. Prior to weaning, their aquatic skills develop to the degree that they spend about half their time in the water, diving for up to 5.5 minutes to depths of up to 84 m (Lydersen et al. 1994). Mothers spend over 80% of their time in the water while caring for a dependent pup (Lydersen and Kovacs 1999); about half that time is spent away from the neonate, presumably in foraging dives. Females haul-out to nurse their pups on average three times a day. The small amount of time mothers spend out of the water when pups are young is thought to be an adaptive response to Polar Bear predation; when only the pup is on the surface, the pair is less conspicuous to hunting bears (Krafft et al. 2000). Mating takes place at the end of lactation similar to other phocid seals. Males court females and display using elaborate downward trilling vocalizations that can travel many kilometres (Cleator et al. 1989). Individual males use distinct songs, and occupy the same territories over a series of consecutive years within constraints imposed by variable ice conditions, or they show a roaming pattern (Van Parijs et al. 2001, 2003, 2004). Males exhibit aggression with each other during breeding, including bubble-blowing and physical combat so the mating system is presumably polygynous to some degree.Bearded seals have an extended moulting period and animals can be found shedding hair from April to August, though there appears to be a peak in May/June for both subspecies (Burns 1981, Gjertz et al. 2000).  During the moult they spend much of their time hauled out and are reluctant to enter the water (Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). Bearded seals use sea ice as a haulout platform on a year-round basis whenever it is available, preferring small and medium sized floes and generally avoiding large floes (Simpkins et al. 2003). However, they will haul out on land in the summer in the absence of sea ice (e.g., Burns 1981, Merkel et al. 2013).  They are rarely found more than a body length from access to water even if hauled out on land (Kovacs 2009).Bearded Seals naturally occur at quite low densities (Bengtson et al. 2005); they are typically solitary animals, but they do form small, loose aggregations at times (Burns 1981). Studies conducted on Atlantic Bearded Seal lactating females and pups (Gjertz et al. 2000, Krafft et al. 2000) have shown that diving depths largely reflect local bathymetry in coastal areas.  This reflects their benthic foraging habits; Bearded Seals feed primarily on or near the bottom and most diving is to depths of less than 100 m (though dives of adults have been recorded up to 300 m and young-of-the-year have been recorded diving down to almost 500 m; Gjertz et al. 2000). They use their elaborate whiskers to search for food items on and in soft bottom substrates and have powerful suction abilities to extract prey (Marshall et al. 2006, 2008). The diet of Bearded Seals varies by age, location, and season (Lowry et al. 1980). Polar Cod (Boreogadis saida), Sculpins, Spider Crab, and Shrimps (Sabinea sptemcarinatus and Sclerocrangon boreas) are the most frequent prey items in Svalbard (Hjelset et al. 1999). However, Cod, other demersal fish, and worms are also regular components of the diet in this area. A wide variety of prey has been reported from the Okhotsk Sea, with Crabs, Shrimps, Clams, Snails, and Worms accounting for most of their diet (Burns 1981). Quakenbush et al. (2011) analyzed the frequency of occurrence of prey in 943 Bearded Seal stomachs collected from the Bering and Chukchi Seas during 1960-2009 and identified 213 different prey taxa. The most commonly eaten groups were Crabs, Shrimps, Clams, Snails, benthic and demersal fishes, and echiuroid worms. These authors found a significant increase in consumption of gadid fishes, principally Arctic Cod (Boreogadus saida) and Saffron Cod (Eleginus gracilis), from the 1960s to the 2000s.Bearded Seals are preyed upon by Polar Bears, Killer Whales, Greenland Sharks, and Pacific Walruses (Lowry and Fay 1984, Lowry et al. 1987, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006).","Global climate warming is currently causing major reductions in the extent and duration of sea ice cover in the Arctic, creating a threat to many species of ice-associated marine mammals. Pinnipeds such as the Bearded Seal that are dependent on sea ice for pupping, moulting, resting, and access to foraging areas, may be especially vulnerable to such changes (Laidre et al. 2008, 2015; Kovacs 2011, 2012). In 2012, Bearded Seals were listed under the US Endangered Species Act following a detailed review of their status and threats (Cameron et al. 2010) because of the threats posed from climate change induced losses in sea ice and ocean acidification due to climate warming, as well as increasing industrial activities in a more ice-free Arctic (Federal Register 2012). Increasing development and industrialization of the Arctic may threaten Bearded Seals in several ways. Oil spills from offshore extraction and transportation could negatively affect them through direct contact with oil and damage to foraging areas and stocks of prey, particularly benthic invertebrates, that are vulnerable to oil contamination. An increase in human-created noise in the arctic environment could cause marine mammals, including Bearded Seals that are very vocal during their breeding season, to abandon areas of habitat they otherwise might use. Increased shipping will pose a greater threat of marine accidents and disturbance of marine mammals. Cameron et al. (2010) concluded that these factors could constitute low to moderate threats to Bearded Seals.Hunting by indigenous peoples continues throughout most of the species range. There is no evidence of any impact from hunting on Bearded Seal population numbers. For example, reports from Alaska Native subsistence hunters do not give any indication that Bearded Seal numbers have declined (Quakenbush et al. 2011).","Population sizes and trends are unknown for all populations of the Atlantic Bearded Seal (see Laidre et al. 2015 for a summary). An estimate for Canadian waters of 190,000 animals was suggested by Cleator (1996), based on data collected over a 35-year period, but this number is really an educated guess as opposed to an actual estimate and in any case is now dated. The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada more recently assessed the status of this species in Canada as being data deficient (COSEWIC 2007). They are also listed on Greenland’s Red List as being data deficient (Boertmann 2007). There have never been any surveys for Bearded Seals in Norwegian waters (Kovacs and Lydersen 2006) or Russian territories in the Atlantic Arctic (Reijnders et al. 1993). However, recordings of their distinctive breeding calls via passive acoustic monitoring networks suggest that this species remains widespread and relatively numerous in the Atlantic Arctic (e.g., Moore et al. 2012).Population data are also incomplete for Pacific Bearded Seals, but this subspecies has received considerably more survey effort. Cameron et al. (2010) concluded that the best estimate for the Okhotsk Sea is 95,000 based on data from 1990 (Fedoseev 2000), and that there are no useful abundance estimates for the East Siberian and Beaufort Seas. Aerial surveys in 1999-2000 estimated about 27,000 Bearded Seals in the Alaskan Chukchi Sea. In the Bering Sea, surveys having been conducted by the USA and the Soviet Union/Russia starting in the 1970s. Early efforts, which covered varying areas and used a variety of methods, suggested an abundance of 50,000-100,000 Bearded Seals in the region. More recently, Ver Hoef et al. (2014) analyzed line transect survey data collected in the Bering Sea in spring 2007 using a series of models and estimated there were 61,800 Bearded Seals (95% CI 34,900–171,600) in their study area. Because that study included about half of the available sea ice habitat, Cameron et al. (2010) considered that the total Bearded Seal population in the Bering Sea was about 125,000. It is likely that the total abundance of Pacific Bearded Seals, including the Okhotsk Sea, is at least 250,000.The global population size of Bearded Seals is unknown. Current population trends are also unknown.",Unknown,"Bearded Seals have a patchy circumpolar distribution throughout much of the Arctic and sub-Arctic, south of 85ºN. In the Pacific sector they range from the Arctic Ocean south through the East Siberian, Beaufort, Chukchi, and Bering Seas (Burns 1981). They also occupy all of Hudson Bay and much of the eastern Canadian Archipelago south to southern Labrador, and both coasts of Greenland. They occur along the north shore of Iceland, within the Svalbard Archipelago, in the drifting pack ice of the Barents Sea and across much of the north coast of the Russian Federation (Kovacs 2009). Bearded Seal vagrants have been reported from many locations outside the Arctic including Portugal (van Bree 2000), the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, northern Newfoundland, and Massachusetts (Gosselin and Boily 1994) in the North Atlantic, as well as in Japan and China in the North Pacific (Rice 1998). Bearded Seals are strongly associated with sea ice and are benthic feeders, and these two attributes explain much of their seasonal movement patterns and their general distribution. While they are not strictly migratory, Bearded Seals in the Bering-Chukchi region undergo seasonal movements linked with the advance and retreat of sea ice (Burns 1981, Cameron et al. 2010). However, in some other regions they are quite sedentary throughout the year, such as in Svalbard, Norway (Kovacs and Lydersen 2006).","Indigenous peoples of the Arctic have hunted Bearded Seals for subsistence for thousands of years, a practice that continues today throughout much of the species’ range. However, levels of subsistence harvest are not well known. Subsistence harvests of Bearded Seals in Alaska were estimated to average approximately 6,800/year during 1990-1998 (Allen and Angliss 2010). Some animals are struck and lost, especially from late spring to mid summer when they are thinnest, and if those animals are accounted for the annual Alaska harvest could be as high as 10,000. An additional 1,000-2,000 may be taken by coastal hunters in Chukotka (Cameron et al. 2010). Subsistence harvest levels are not closely monitored in Canada, but Cleator (1996) estimated that roughly 2,400 Bearded Seals were taken per year. In Greenland Bearded Seals make up only 1-2% of the Seal catch (Garde 2013), with some few hundred taken annually. Bearded Seals are hunted at low levels in Svalbard currently, but during the whaling period individual boats would take hundreds. They are also harvested in the White Sea. The former Soviet Union historically conducted ship-based commercial harvests of Bearded Seals in the North Pacific region, in the Bering, Chukchi, and Okhotsk Seas. Harvests grew from 9,000 to 13,000 for the Bering and Okhotsk seas combined during 1957-1964, and were 8,000 to 10,000 per year during 1964-1967 (Reeves et al. 1992). Ship-based harvests were suspended from 1970 to 1975, and took place at lower levels when they resumed (Kelly 1988). There is currently no significant commercial harvest of Bearded Seals in Russia.",Terrestrial|Marine,"Within the USA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act generally prohibits taking of Bearded Seals unless it is by an Alaska Native for subsistence or production of handicrafts. In 2012, Bearded Seals in the Bering-Chukchi and Okhotsk Seas were listed as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act (Federal Register 2012). In Canada, subsistence hunting of Bearded Seals is co-managed by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and regional resource boards (Cameron et al. 2010). Licensed hunters can shoot Bearded Seals in Svalbard, outside protected areas and during open seasons, that are set in periods when Bearded Seals shot in the water are least likely to sink (Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). In Russia, the “Law of Fisheries and Preservation of Aquatic Resources” provides for subsistence harvest of Seals by aboriginal Russian peoples, and a total allowable catch is determined annually. Russia is the only nation to set a quota on the number of Bearded Seals that can be harvested, it is an “open” hunt in all other regions.Bearded Seals are able to use glacier ice pieces that have calved into the sea as haul-out platforms, so tidal glacier fronts are increasingly important to them in areas where sea ice declines are marked (Lydersen et al. 2014). Tidal glacier fjords may represent important breeding refugias in the future as sea ice continues to decline and this habitat type should be considered for special conservation status.",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45226042,9660,Halichoerus grypus,Least Concern,,2016,2016-03-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Grey Seal has the same geographic distribution as in the late 19th century with areas of its range having been recolonized over the past 30-40 years. Their abundance has increased in all regions in the past several decades. Total abundance globally is more than 600,000. Changes in juvenile survival and pup production suggest that some colonies may be approaching a resource ceiling. Grey Seals do not meet IUCN criteria for any threatened category and are listed as Least Concern.","Grey Seals are a large sexually dimorphic phocid. Northwest Atlantic Grey Seals are significantly larger than Northeast Atlantic animals. In the UK, adult males are on average 2 m long and weigh 233 kg, with a maximum of 310 kg. Adult females average 1.8 m and 155 kg. At birth, pups are 90-105 cm, with male pups averaging 15.8 kg in weight and female pups averaging 14.8 kg (Bonner 1981). Weaning weights average 40 kg for males and 35.8-39.6 kg for females. In the Western Atlantic adult males are on average 2.1 m long and weigh 267 kg, with a maximum of 370 kg (Bowen unpub. data). Adult females average 1.9 m in length and weigh 186 kg with a maximum of 256 kg (Iverson et al. 1993). Newborn pups average 16.6 kg or about 14% of maternal body mass (Mellish et al. 1999). In North America, pups are heavier at birth than pups born in the UK and are 25% heavier at weaning. At the time of weaning, male pups average 56.2 kg and females 51.6 kg, as measured for pups born on the ice near Amet Island (Haller et al. 1996). Male pups weigh 56.6 and females weigh 54.5 kg for those born on land at Sable Island (Bowen et al. 2006). Baltic Grey Seal pups weigh about 12 kg at birth, but weaning mass differs between ice-born pups (48.3 kg) and those born on land (37.4 kg) (Jüssi et al. 2008). Survival to recruitment to the breeding population is positively related to pup size at weaning (Bowen et al. 2015).Lactation lasts around 15-18 days on average, with ice breeders having slightly shorter lactation periods; weaning is abrupt (Kovacs 1987, Haller et al. 1996, Bowen et al. 2006). Pre-weaning mortality of Grey Seal pups varies widely between colonies; it is usually between 5 and 20% but can be as high as 30% (Bowen et al. 2007, Hammill et al. 2014). Pup mortality rates are influenced by habitat quality, birth site, quality of maternal care, injuries resulting from male-male aggression, and to a lesser extent predation by Greater and Lesser Black-backed Gulls (Larus marinus and L. fuscus) on weakened, unprotected, pups, or pups born on the periphery of a colony (Baker and Baker 1988, Twiss et al. 2003).In the Baltic, pre-weaning mortality is low for pups born on ice, but varies between 5 and 30% on land, depending on pupping density (Jüssi et al. 2008). The main predators in this region are White-tailed Eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla) and Greater Black-backed Gulls.In the UK, females give birth on land and show considerable site fidelity (Pomeroy et al. 1994), although this is not observed elsewhere. Mothers typically stay with their pups until weaning (Boness and James 1979), but are rarely more than a few meters away from water at some UK colonies (Twiss et al. 1994). Reproductive performance of adult females varies with age and body mass. Females in their late 20s and older show evidence of reduced reproductive success, caused by senescence (Bowen et al. 2006).In the Gulf of St Lawrence, lactating females that give birth on the ice spend about 72% of their time hauled out, nursing the pup every 2-3 hours. From the time of birth until weaning, females lose about 5.7 kg per day (Lydersen et al. 1994). Females in the UK lose an average of 65 kg over the lactation period (Fedak and Anderson 1982), whereas the somewhat larger females in the Northwest Atlantic lose an average of 75 kg (Haller et al. 1996, Mellish et al. 1999). Females come into estrus around the time of weaning (Boness et al. 1982). Females are at their lowest weight following the moulting period, averaging 126.2 kg in Canadian colonies; by the beginning of the next pupping period they again average 210 kg (Beck et al. 2003a).Adult male Grey Seals come ashore about the time the first pups are born (Boness and James 1979, Bonner 1981). Their average age when first returning to their breeding colonies is 9-10 years at Sable Island (Manske et al. 2002). Males spend large amounts of time out of the water fasting during the breeding season. Some males go to sea for periods of 2-3 days while others remain hauled out for the entire breeding season (Lidgard et al. 2003). Males do not defend a fixed territory, but stay near a particular group of females (Lidgard et al. 2001). Breeding age males lose less weight per day than lactating females, but because they are ashore for an average of 36 days, up to an extreme of 57days, they can experience considerable loss of mass (Anderson and Fedak 1985, Lidgard et al. 2005, Tinker et al. 1995).Pupping dates differ significantly between populations: peak dates in the Northwest Atlantic are in January; in the Northeast Atlantic peak dates vary between September and December in different subpopulations; and in the Baltic Sea peak pupping is in late February to early March, which coincides with the annual maximum ice coverage. The differences in pupping seasons probably keep the groups reproductively isolated (Bonner 1981). Pups are born on land in the Northeast Atlantic, and can be born on either ice or land in the Northwest Atlantic and in the Baltic (Bonner 1981, Baker et al. 1995). Pups are born with a woolly white lanugo that is moulted around the time of weaning. Pups stay on land from birth until the moult is finished (Noren et al. 2008), although some pups on small exposed beaches often swim for short periods even before moulting (Kovacs 1987). During the post weaning fast pups lose up to 25% of their body mass (Noren et al. 2008). In the United Kingdom, adult females moult from mid-January to mid-February, and males moult from mid-February through early April. In Canada, the moult is later in the spring, with females moulting in May-June and males about a month later (Beck et al. 2003a). Peak moulting season for Baltic seals is the last week of May to the second week in June.Grey Seals are shallow, short-duration divers. Most adult diving is shallower than 120 m and shorter than 8 min. (Beck et al. 2003b). Female’s dives are on average slightly longer (5.5 min.) than those of males (4.9 min.), although males tend to dive somewhat deeper (57 m compared to 49 m) (Beck et al. 2003b). On the Scotian Shelf, maximum dives recorded were 412 m for males, and 354 m for females (Beck et al. 2003b). Typically in the UK, dives are shorter and shallower (average 4-10 min., maximum 30 min.). In European waters Grey Seals are primarily demersal feeders, diving to the seabed during most dives (usually 60 m, but down to 200 m in some areas; Thompson et al. 1991).Grey Seals are not long-distance migrants. In Europe, tracking of individual seals has shown that they can feed up to several hundred kilometres offshore during short foraging trips lasting 2.3 days on average (McConnell et al. 1999). Individual Grey Seals, based at specific haulout sites, often make repeated trips to the same region offshore but will occasionally move to a new haulout and begin foraging in a new region. Movements of Grey Seals between haul-outs in the North Sea and the Shetland Isles, Outer Hebrides, and Faeroe Islands have been recorded. During foraging trips Grey Seals often target areas with fine gravel/coarse sandy sea-bed sediments, which are the preferred habitat of Sandeels (Ammodytes sp.), an important part of the Grey Seal’s diet.Satellite telemetry data from Canada show that Grey Seals there perform much longer foraging trips (averaging 5-12 days) and often travel much larger distances than European Grey Seals (Breed et al. 2009). Foraging trip characteristics differ seasonally and by sex. Females typically fed closer to haulouts than males and spent more time foraging at these patches (Breed et al. 2009). Grey Seals in Canada also exhibit pronounced seasonal sex segregation in foraging distribution (Breed et al. 2006). In the Baltic Sea, Grey Seals make short feeding trips, spending roughly 75% of their time within 50 km of haulout sites (Sjøberg and Ball 2000).Grey Seals are generalist predators, consuming a wide range of species, although typically fewer than 10 species comprise most of the diet (Bowen and Siniff 1999). Grey Seal diet varies by seasonally and location, though they are largely demersal or benthic feeders (Bowen et al. 1993, Hall 2002). At times in Canada and the North Sea, the food consumed by Grey Seals can be over 50% Sandeels, although several dozen species are eaten (Bowen and Harrison 1994, Hammond et al. 1994, Beck et al. 2007). In Iceland, where 15 species make up the majority of the diet, the most common stomach contents by weight are Atlantic Cod (Gadus morhua) 24%, Sandeels 23%, Catfish (Wolf-fish Anarhichas lupus) 15%, and Saithe (Pollachius virens) 11% (Hauksson and Bogason 1997). At the Faroes, adults feed on Cod and Catfish, subadults feed on Sandeels and Saithe, and juveniles consume Sandeels (Mikkelsen et al. 2002). In the United Kingdom, Sandeels, Cod, and Dover Sole (Solea solea) account for 56% of the diet by weight. Grey Seals also eat other flatfish, including Dab (Limanda limanda), Flounder (Platichthys plessus), and Plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) (Prime and Hammond 1990). In the Outer Hebrides, gadids account for 40% or more of the diet (Ling, Molva molva), Atlantic Cod, and Whiting (Merlangius merlangus); Sandeels are less important in this area (Hammond et al. 1994). In Canada, the dominant prey species consumed by Seals differs by season, sex, and age-class; however, Sandeels and Redfish (Sebastes sp.) together accounted for 40-91% of the diet in all seasons, sexes, and age-classes (Bowen and Harrison 1994). Pollock (Pollachius virens), and flounders (Turbot Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, Witch Glyptocephalus cynoglossus, and Yellowtail Limanda ferruginea) account for more than 10% of the diet in some demographic groups within seasons (Beck et al. 2007). Atlantic Cod can be an important part of the diet in some areas and seasons (Hammill et al. 2014).","Grey Seals have been important in subsistence harvests in coastal areas within their range throughout history. They have been hunted in the Baltic Sea for more than 10,000 years (Härkönen et al. 2005). Commercial harvesting has been ongoing in many areas for hundreds of years, and at times Grey Seals have been important to local economies (Mansfield 1988). Over-harvesting in the Baltic in the early 20th century led to a large decline; this population once numbered somewhere between 80,000 and 100,000, but was reduced to about 20,000 in the 1940s. A further decline to 1,500-2,000 seals was caused by high loads of PCB (Harding and Härkönen 1999).Government culls, bounties and licensed kills for protection of fishing gear have been put into effect in many countries and continue to be used to control Grey Seal numbers and reduce their impact on commercially important coastal fisheries (i.e., salmonid fisheries). Grey Seals feed on a number of commercial species, and by damaging nets and traps they are in direct conflict with fisheries. They also are vectors for parasites that can have an impact on the economics of some fisheries (ICES 2005).Entanglement in commercial fishing nets causes by-catch mortality in most parts of the Grey Seals’ range (Woodley and Lavigne 1991). By-catch levels are approximately 300 per year in Swedish fisheries in the Baltic (ICES 2005). A Norwegian study from 1975-1998 reported the death of 259 seals, primarily juveniles less than a year old, which represented 7% of the tagged animals in the region (Bjørge et al. 2002). Among 528 deaths of tagged seals in the UK, 148 were attributable to fishing nets. However, this may overestimate the rate of entanglement-related mortality due to the high rate of tag returns from fisheries. Woodley and Lavigne (1991) suggested that 1-2% of animals less than a year old die in fishing gear. More recent photographic analysis of Grey Seals at haulout sites on Cape Cod, Massachusetts revealed 5-8% of Seals exhibited signs of entanglement (Sette et al. 2009). Finally, in the US commercial fisheries there was an average annual mortality of 853 Grey Seals reported for the period 2006-2010 (Waring et al. 2013). For the period 2008-2012, the total estimated human caused mortality (and serious injury to) Grey Seals was 4,533 per year of which about 1,000 were taken in US observed fisheries, about 400 in the Canadian hunt, 90 taken by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) in scientific collections, and about 3,000 were killings of nuisance animals in Canada (DFO 2011).Grey Seals are known carriers of phocine distemper virus (PDV), in all populations (Ross et al. 1992, Duignan et al. 1995, Härkönen et al. 2006). However, they have suffered almost no mortality from the disease, in marked contrast to Harbour Seals. Härkönen et al. (2006) report Grey Seal mortality of approximately 230 (equal to 1% of the Harbour Seal mortality) in the 1988 epizootic in Europe and the death of 30 Grey Seal pups in the Baltic were attributed to PDV. Because Grey Seals haulout with Harbour Seals in the Wadden Sea and are known to travel more widely than the more sedentary Harbour Seal, it is presumed that they had a role in the outbreak and spread of the 2002 epizootic of PDV in Harbour Seals (Härkönen et al. 2006).Grey Seals are exposed to agricultural pollutants through the food chain in their coastal ranges. PCBs and DDT contaminant loads are extremely high in Baltic Grey Seals, despite the fact that tissue burdens have declined since the 1970s. Analysis of samples collected from 1996 to 1998 indicated that Grey Seals still have a very heavy load of contaminants when compared to other Seals outside the Baltic (ICES 2005).Health effects on Grey Seals have been suggested to be linked to their high exposures to PCBs and DDT. Baltic Grey Seals have a relatively high rate of colonic ulcers associated with hookworm infestations, which are sometimes fatal. This condition is not found elsewhere (ICES 2005). Uterine stenosis and a host of other pathologies in other organs have been attributed to long-term exposure to environmental toxics, particularly in older Baltic Grey Seals. These are specifically linked to reproductive and population declines for this subspecies and are conditions not seen in other populations (Bergman et al. 2001). However, no negative effects have been attributed to heavy metal contaminants in Baltic Grey Seals (Bergman et al. 2001, ICES 2005).Grey Seals live close to human population centres and shipping lanes and spend much of their time in the vicinity of favourite haulout locations. Spilled oil from vessel accidents and other sources have fouled Grey Seal sites since at least the 1940s (St. Aubin 1990). Despite numerous records of oiled animals and occasional reports of dead animals coated in oil, or animals having ingested oil, it has not been determined whether those mortalities are attributable to contact with oil (St. Aubin 1990).","Available data on Grey Seal abundance were compiled and reviewed in the 2016 IUCN Red List assessments for the two recognized subspecies. Estimates of the number of mature individuals, and population trend, were as follows: Northeast Atlantic Grey Seal 66,000, increasing; Northwest Atlantic Grey Seal 250,000, increasing. The world-wide population of Grey Seals is estimated to contain about 316,000 mature individuals and the total population size is about 632,000.",Increasing,"Grey Seals have a cold temperate to sub-Arctic distribution in North Atlantic waters over the continental shelf (Hall 2002). There are three populations isolated both geographically and by the timing of reproduction (Bonner 1981); mtDNA differences are large between these three breeding areas, though the Baltic and Northeast Atlantic populations are much closer to one another than to the Northwest Atlantic population (Boskovic et al. 1996). In the western Atlantic, the population is centered on the eastern Scotian Shelf off northeastern North America, but the Grey Seal ranges from the Gulf of Maine to southern Labrador, including the Gulf of St Lawrence (Lesage and Hammill 2001). The northeast Atlantic population is concentrated around the UK and Ireland but is also found around Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and along the European mainland coast from the Kola Peninsula south to southern Norway, and from Denmark to Brittany in France. The Baltic Sea subpopulation is confined to the Baltic Sea (Bonner 1981, Hall 2002). Vagrants are known from as far south as New Jersey in the western Atlantic and Portugal in the eastern Atlantic (Rice 1998).","Grey Seals have been important in subsistence harvests in coastal areas within their range throughout history. Grey Seals are protected in the USA under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and in Canada under the Fisheries Act. Nevertheless, there is a management plan that permits commercial harvesting of Grey Seals in Canadian waters, although relatively few Seals are taken each year. Grey Seal pups were taken in Orkney until the early 1980s, partly for commercial exploitation and partly as a population control measure. Large-scale culls of Grey Seals in the North Sea, Orkney, and Hebrides were carried out in the 1960s and 1970s as population control measures.In Norway, hunting quotas are set within the context of a Grey Seal management plan and bounties have also been paid to reduce numbers in areas where there are conflicts with fisheries (Nilssen and Haug 2007). Hunting of Grey Seals is also permitted in Iceland (Hauksson 2007). In the Faroe Islands, licenses to kill Grey Seals are issued for the purpose of protecting marine fish farming (Mikkelsen 2007).",Terrestrial|Marine,"Numerous countries have invoked protective measures to limit Grey Seal harvests, culls, disturbance, and by-catch (Bonner 1981, ICES 2005). Pollutant loads in Baltic Grey Seals have declined following regulations banning the use and discharge of toxic pollutants such as DDT and PCBs beginning in the 1970s. Although the prevalence of colonic ulcers has increased over the last decades, the reproductive health of female Grey Seals has improved as has the population level in the Baltic (Bergman et al. 2001). Establishment of coastal marine reserves for Seals in Norway have been more effective in protecting Harbour Seals than Grey Seals because the latter are more likely to travel outside the areas closed to fisheries and become entangled in nets (Bjørge et al. 2002).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45226422,10340,Hydrurga leptonyx,Least Concern,,2015,2015-01-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The most recent circumpolar estimate of Leopard Seal abundance indicates a total population of more than 35,000 individuals, but this is likely a substantial underestimate. There is no indication of a declining trend in the population, although abundance estimates have considerable uncertainty around them and consequently trend is unknown. Leopard Seals depend on sea ice for reproduction and at some time in the future they could be adversely affected by a reduction in sea ice due to continued climate warming. Leopard Seals are currently a widespread and abundant species that does not qualify for any of the IUCN threatened categories, and they should be listed as Least Concern.","Adult male Leopard Seals are 2.8 to 3.3 m long and weigh up to 300 kg. Adult females are 2.9 to 3.6 m, with very large animals possibly reaching 3.8 m, and weights of 260 to upwards of 500 kg. Pups are 1.0 to 1.6 m in length and weigh 30 to 35 kg at birth. The age at sexual maturity is probably four years for females and 4.5 years for males. Longevity is estimated to be over 26 years (Kooyman 1981, Rogers 2009). At sea and on the ice, Leopard Seals tend to be solitary. Pups are born on sea ice from early November to late December and the period may be as long as early October to early January (Southwell et al. 2003). Births at South Georgia occur from late August to the middle of September. Pups are probably weaned at four weeks old, and female oestrous occurs at or shortly after weaning. Unlike Crabeater Seals, male Leopard Seals do not haul out with female-pup pairs. Mating is believed to occur in the water, but has never been observed.Leopard Seals are well known for preying upon penguins. However, their diet is in reality highly varied and changes with seasonal and local abundance of prey. Leopard Seals will consume krill, fish, squid, penguins, a variety of other types of seabirds, and juvenile seals including Crabeater, Southern Elephant and Fur Seals (Rogers 2009, Southwell et al. 2012). In the case of Antarctic Fur Seals, it has been proposed that predation of Leopard Seals on pups might have a significant role in driving population dynamics of the prey species in certain areas (Schwarz et al. 2013). Most prey are caught in the water. Penguins are usually held in the Leopard Seal's teeth by one end and slung in an arc with a rapid snap of the head and neck and smashed on the surface of the water until they are torn open. Smaller pieces are then swallowed. Young, newly fledged naïve penguins are most vulnerable, but adult birds are taken as well. Leopard Seals patrol and regularly station themselves just off Penguin colonies and wait to ambush and chase animals transiting to and from the colonies (Rogers and Bryden 1995).  Krill may be a seasonally important prey (Lowry et al. 1988). There have been few studies of Leopard Seal diving. Two seals tagged with satellite-linked dive recorders dove mostly to 10-50 m, and the deepest dive recorded was 304 m (Nordøy and Blix 2009).","There are currently no major threats from human activity within the species’ normal range. Learmonth et al. (2006) list the effects of global climate change on Leopard Seals as unknown. However, loss of sufficient areas of pack ice habitat suitable for pupping, resting and avoidance of predators, and availability of preferred prey such as Penguins, other Seals, Krill and fish that might all possibly decline, could effect Leopard Seals directly or indirectly to an unknown degree. The effects of loss of large amounts of ice on the Antarctic continent, general climate warming, or sea level rises, on Antarctic ocean circulation and productivity and on Antarctic marine resources such as Seals are unknown. Siniff et al. (2008) suggested that similar to Crabeater Seals, Leopard Seals would be less affected by changes in sea ice than Ross or Weddell Seals. Two species of Antarctic ice seals, Leopard and Crabeater, have tested positive for antibodies to canine distemper virus (CDV). The effects of an outbreak of this or other diseases on Leopard Seals either as a disease within this species, or repeatedly transmitted to it from an outbreak in a prey species such as the Crabeater Seal, are unknown. Leopard Seals are generally solitary except when females attend their pup or when pairs mate, so transmission of disease within the species would likely be slow or only seasonally significant. CDV is believed to have arrived in the Antarctic with sled dogs before the advent of vaccines. A mass mortality of Crabeater Seals occurred in 1955, with many animals displaying viral illness symptoms prior to death, but the exact cause of death is unknown (Bengtson and Boveng 1991).Seasonal tourism in the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic has increased steadily in the last 30 plus years, and is currently at all-time high levels. The effects of increased vessel noise, disturbance from vessels passage, and close approaches by people in small boats and on land on Leopard Seal behaviour, distribution and foraging are unknown. There is also a risk of injury to a small number of animals from collision with boats or crushing from large vessels passing through ice fields.There are no reports of significant fisheries interactions. Commercial harvest of Krill may pose direct or indirect threats to Leopard Seals, if conducted on a large scale.","The Leopard Seal is a widespread species and, similar to the other Antarctic seals that inhabit the pack ice, population assessments are very difficult and expensive to conduct and therefore undertaken infrequently. Published global population estimates from many decades ago range from 100,000-300,000 (Scheffer 1958) up to 220,000-440,000 animals (Laws 1984). However, these early estimates were based on very limited sampling and were highly speculative. An analysis of ship and aerial sighting surveys carried out around the continent between 1968 and 1983 provided a point estimate for global Leopard Seal population size in the pelagic pack ice of the Southern Ocean of 300,000 animals (Erickson and Hanson 1990). The most ambitious and coordinated effort to date, the Antarctic Pack-Ice Seal (APIS) project, conducted aerial and shipboard surveys around the continent during 1996-2001, and also included deployment of satellite-linked dive recorders to investigate haulout behaviour. APIS surveys resulted in an estimate of 35,500 (95% CL 10,900-102,600) Leopard Seals in the surveyed areas (Southwell et al. 2012). All estimates have considerable uncertainty associated with them, and only very large changes in Leopard Seal population size could be confidently detected from repeated surveys (Southwell et al. 2008).",Unknown,"Leopard Seals are widely distributed in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters of the Southern Hemisphere, occurring from the coast of the Antarctic continent northward throughout the pack ice and at most sub-Antarctic islands. There is a seasonal presence of juveniles at Kerguelen and Macquarie Islands with the greatest numbers being sighted in September and October (Rounseveld and Eberhard 1980, Borsa 1990).

Adults in their prime weigh 400-450 kg, with females being somewhat heavier than males, sometimes reaching over 500 kg (Stirling 1971). Adult female weight fluctuates dramatically during the year with significant weight loss occurring after birth and during lactation. Newborns are about 1.5 m long and average 29 kg. Females become mature at three to six years of age and males at seven to eight years. The annual pregnancy rate of mature females is 70-80%. Gestation lasts 11 months, including a delay of implantation of two months. Longevity is approximately 25 years (Stirling 1971, Reijnders et al. 1990).Weddell Seals breed in areas of predictable stable fast ice or on land, allowing them to form loose aggregations (or breeding colonies) at specific sites (Siniff 1981, Testa et al. 1990). Weddell Seal pups are born from October through November. Adult females nurse their pups for a prolonged period (seven to eight weeks), and although they fast during the first one to two weeks, adult females do forage during lactation (Stirling 1971). Pups are born earlier at lower latitudes than at higher latitudes (Testa et al. 1990). Females enter oestrus approximately one week before weaning their pup, and copulation occurs underwater, where males maintain territories by controlling access to breathing holes and cracks. Adult Weddell Seals display strong site fidelity, with both males and females returning to the same breeding colony. When in the shore-fast ice habitat, Weddell Seals tend to congregate in loose groups along recurrent cracks, leads, and near access holes to the water (Siniff 1981). The behaviour of animals breeding in the pack ice or in the Sub-Antarctic islands is not well known. Satellite data on movement patterns of Weddell Seals have increased during the last decade, providing a clearer picture of their distribution patterns. Weddell Seals habitat utilization and habitat patterns vary largely at a regional scale, showing large differences in the scale of their movements (tens to hundreds of km) depending on the area they inhabit (K. T. Goetz pers. comm., Heerah et al. 2013). Further, there seems to be large individual variability in their patterns of habitat usage, with some individuals staying in close proximity to their breeding colonies (e.g., McMurdo Sound), whereas others venture into the pack ice, likely exploiting polynyas and areas of thinner sea ice. The data available on newly weaned and subadult animals seem to indicate that younger animals move north from the continent and spend the winter in the pack ice. The diving behaviour of Weddell Seals has been well studied, particularly at McMurdo Sound. They can reach depths of over 600 m, and can undertake dives of at least 82 minutes, feeding primarily feed at depths of 100–350 m, with a diurnal feeding pattern (Testa 1994). Weddell Seals are generalist predators, and their diet likely varies at a regional scale. Their diet primarily consists of notothenoid fish (Icefishes), particularly the Antarctic Silverfish which largely dominates in the diet in certain areas (Burns et al. 1998), but also includes Antarctic Toothfish, Myctophids and Cephalopods. Although Weddell Seals in fast ice areas are relatively protected, animals in the pack ice are vulnerable to predation by Killer Whales and Leopard Seals (Stirling 1969a, Visser et al. 2008). Weddell Seals that remain in fast ice areas abrade and grind the ice to maintain access to and from the water. They bite at the ice and then rapidly swing the head from side to side to grind away the ice with their teeth (Stirling 1969ab). Such behaviour, though, comes at a cost, as Seals living in areas where extensive grinding of ice is necessary have accelerated wearing down of their teeth and decreased life expectancy (Stirling 1969b).","At present, there are no immediate or significant threats to the Weddell Seal.The potential effects of global climate change on Antarctic seals are largely unknown. Sea ice provides habitat used for pupping, resting, avoidance of predators and access to preferred foraging areas. Learmonth et al. (2006) suggest that Weddell Seal numbers may decline with increasing temperatures if Antarctic sea ice is significantly reduced. In contrast, Proffit et al. (2007), reported that the localized cooling and increased sea ice extent in the Ross Sea was associated with decreased reproduction and lower weaning mass of Weddell Seals in McMurdo Sound. Further, the fact that some populations breed on land (e.g., at South Georgia), could demonstrate an ability in the species to colonize different environments, although the extent of such plasticity is uncertain. Thus, the overall effects of global climate change on Weddell Seals are unknown.Seasonal tourism in the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic has increased steadily in the last 30 plus years, and is currently at all-time high levels. The effects of increased vessel noise, disturbance from vessels passage, and close approach by people in small boats and on land or ice, on Weddell Seal behaviour, distribution and foraging are unknown. There is also a risk of injury to a small number of animals from collision with boats or crushing from large vessel passage through ice fields. Currently there are no reports of significant fisheries interactions. However, the development of new fisheries in Antarctic waters, particularly one targeting the Antarctic Toothfish, could have an impact on Weddell Seal nutrition, and potential operational interactions should be considered in the management plans.","The global population of Weddell Seals has been variously estimated at 200,000 to 1,000,000 individuals (Erickson and Hanson 1990, Southwell et al. 2012), although there is large uncertainty in these figures. Weddell Seals are a widespread species and population assessments are very difficult and expensive to conduct, and are therefore infrequently undertaken. Southwell et al. (2012) reported on results from the Antarctic Pack-Ice Seals program which conducted extensive surveys during 1996-2001. They estimated 633,000 Weddell Seals in two of their survey sectors. In the third sector fast ice was not surveyed and Weddell Seal abundance was not estimated. ",Unknown,"Circumpolar and widespread in the Southern Ocean, Weddell Seals are the world’s southern-most breeding mammal and occur in large numbers on fast ice, right up to the shoreline of the Antarctic continent. They also occur offshore in the pack ice zone north to the seasonally shifting limits of the Antarctic Convergence. A small population lives all year on South Georgia. Weddell Seals are present at many islands along the Antarctic Peninsula that are seasonally ice-free. Vagrants have been recorded in many areas north of the Antarctic in South America, New Zealand and southern Australia (Kooyman 1981, Rice 1998).","Weddell Seals served as an important source of food for men and dogs throughout the early periods of Antarctic exploration (Stirling 1971) until the final removal of dogs from the continent in the 1990s. Local populations no doubt suffered declines from these harvests, but the Murdo Sound population has recovered in the 30 years since harvests ended in the 1980s (Testa and Siniff 1987).",Terrestrial|Marine,"The Weddell Seal is not listed as endangered or threatened under any national Red List.

Neonates are thought to be at least 1.1 m and 20-40 kg. The mean age of sexual maturity in females varies from 2.5 to 4.2 years and these variations may be related to changes in food abundance (Bengtson and Laws 1985, Hårding and Härkönen 1995). Annual adult mortality is about 3-10% (Boveng 1993). Crabeater Seal births occur mainly during the second half of October. They do not use specific rookeries. Instead, adult females haul out singly on an ice floe where they give birth, and they are joined by a male shortly after (Siniff et al. 1979, Adam 2005). Adult males attend female-pup pairs and stay with the female until her oestrous begins one to two weeks after the pup is weaned. Mating has not been witnessed and presumably occurs in the water.Pups are born from September to December (Southwell et al. 2003) in a soft woolly coat that is greyish-brown in colour and has been described as light, milk coffee brown, with darker colouring on the flippers. Adult females fast during lactation, and wean their pups after an average of three weeks (Southwell 2004, Adam 2005) at which time pups are moulting from the lanugo coat into a sub-adult pelage similar to that of the adult. Adults and subadults moult in January and February, and a large proportion of the animals in an area are thought to be hauled out during the annual moult.Mortality is high in the first year, possibly reaching 80%. Much of this mortality is attributed to Leopard Seal predation, and up to 78% of Crabeaters that survive through their first year have injuries and scars from Leopard Seal attacks (Siniff and Bengtson 1997). The presence of long scars and sets of parallel scars that are readily visible on the pale, relatively unmarked pelage of Crabeaters, are testimony to the frequency of these attacks on young of this species. Leopard Seal attacks appear to fall off dramatically after Crabeaters reach one year of age (Siniff and Stone 1985).Recent research has revealed that Crabeater Seals can dive up to 600 m and stay submerged for 24 minutes, although most feeding dives occur within the top 50 m, and are shorter in duration (Burns et al. 2004, 2008). Foraging occurs primarily at night (Bengtson and Stewart 1992), and instrumented seals have been recorded to dive continuously for periods up to 16 hours. Dives at dawn and dusk are deeper than at night, and indicate that Crabeater feeding activity is also tied to the daily vertical migrations of Krill. They have a general pattern of feeding from dusk until dawn, and hauling-out in the middle of the day.Crabeater Seals feed primarily on Antarctic Krill, Euphausia superba, which accounts for over 90% of their diet, with the remainder made up of fish and squid. New information indicates that the diet composition of the Crabeater Seal can display some plasticity, and they can compensate when Krill availability decreases by incorporating more fish (&gt;25% of their diet; Hückstädt et al. 2012). All of the post-canine teeth are ornate, with multiple accessory cusps that interlock to form a network for straining Krill from the seawater. A ridge of bone on each mandible fills the gap in the mouth behind the last upper post-canine teeth and the back of the jaw, which helps prevent the loss of Krill from the mouth when feeding.Crabeater Seals are frequently encountered alone or in small groups of up to three on the ice or in the water. Much larger groups of up to 1,000 hauled-out together have been observed. They can be seen swimming together in herds estimated to be up to 500 animals, breathing and diving almost synchronously.","There are currently no direct threats from human activity throughout most of the species’ normal range.A mass die-off of Crabeater Seals was reported from an area near a research base on the Antarctic Peninsula in 1955 (Laws and Taylor 1957). About 3,000 animals were trapped in areas five to 25 km from open water and most died over a two to three month period. None of the animals examined appeared to be starving, and numerous abortions of foetuses were noted. A disease outbreak was suspected, but never identified. Antibodies to canine distemper virus were found in Crabeater Seals from this area in 1989 (Bengtson et al. 1991).The effects of global climate change on Antarctic seals are unknown. Learmonth et al. (2006) suggest that Crabeater Seal numbers may decline with increasing temperatures if Antarctic sea ice is significantly reduced. Loss of sufficient areas of pack ice habitat used for pupping, resting, avoidance of predators, and access to preferred foraging areas because of changes from warming could lead to population declines. The loss of sea ice has the potential to negatively impact Crabeater Seals given their high level of specialization on Antarctic Krill. Sea ice coverage is of particular importance for the survival of juvenile stages of Krill, and ultimately determines the biomass of adult Krill that is available for higher trophic level predators. It is unclear whether Crabeater Seals might be able to switch from their highly specialized, Krill-based diet, to a more generalist strategy with rapid loss of sea ice. The effects of loss of large amounts of ice on the Antarctic continent, general climate warming, or sea level rise, on Antarctic Ocean circulation and productivity and on Antarctic marine resources such as seals are unknown.Seasonal tourism in the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic has increased steadily in the last 30 plus years, and is currently at all-time high levels. The effects of increased vessel noise, disturbance from vessel passage, and close approach by people in small boats and on land on Crabeater Seal behaviour, distribution and foraging are unknown. There is a small risk of injury to animals from collision with boats or crushing from large vessel passage through ice fields.There are no reports of significant interactions between Crabeater Seals and fisheries. Commercial harvest of Krill may pose a threat to Crabeater Seals, if it ever becomes established at a large scale.","The Crabeater Seal is a widespread species, and, as is the case for other Seals inhabiting the Antarctic pack ice, population assessments are very difficult and expensive to conduct and therefore infrequently undertaken. Published global population estimates range from two million (Scheffer 1958) up to 50-75 million animals (Erickson et al. 1971). However, early estimates were based on very limited sampling and were highly speculative. The most recent available data, obtained during the multi-national effort conducted under the umbrella of the Antarctic Pack Ice Seal program in the late 1990s, provided a population size estimate of approximately 8,000,000 animals for the area surveyed (Southwell et al. 2012). Considering that major areas of the pack ice around the continent were not surveyed, there is a large uncertainty regarding the actual population size of the species. Yet, Crabeater Seals are considered to be one of the most abundant seal species (if not the most abundant) and one of the most numerous large mammals on Earth.",Unknown,"The distribution of Crabeater Seals is tied to seasonal fluctuations of the pack ice. They can be found right up to the coast and ice shelves of Antarctica, as far south as the Bay of Whales (Lindsey 1938), during late summer ice break-up. They occur in greatest numbers in the seasonally shifting pack ice surrounding the Antarctic continent. As vagrants they travel as far north as New Zealand and the southern coasts of Africa, Australia and South America. Crabeater Seals have been known to occasionally wander far inland and die in the dry valleys adjacent to McMurdo Sound. A live animal was found 113 km from open water at an elevation of 920 m asl, and carcasses have been found as high as 1,100 m asl (Kooyman 1981, Rice 1998).",Several brief episodes of commercial harvesting of Crabeaters ended when they were determined to be economically unsuccessful.,Terrestrial|Marine,The Crabeater Seal is not listed as endangered or threatened on any National Red List.

45227116,13581,Mirounga angustirostris,Least Concern,,2015,2014-12-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Northern Elephant Seal has recovered from near extinction and population growth is expected to continue over the coming decades. Due to its large and increasing population, expanding range and lack of foreseeable threats, the Northern Elephant Seal is listed as Least Concern.","Northern Elephant Seals are the second largest species in the order Pinnipedia and they display significant sexual dimorphism in size and secondary sexual characteristics (Deutsch et al. 1994). Males are three to four times heavier, and nearly 1.5 times the length, of adult females. Adult males reach 4.2 m in length and a maximum weight of 2,500 kg. Mean length for males is 3.85 m and mean weight is 1,844 kg. Maximum weight is seen when the bulls are newly arrived for the breeding season after a summer and fall largely spent feeding (Deutsch et al. 1990). The mean length of adult females is 2.65 m, and they can reach a length of 2.82 m. Mean mass is 488 kg, with a maximum recorded mass of 710 kg, both values are from shortly after females give birth. Newborn pups are about 1.25 m long and weigh 30-40 kg. Pups are born in a long woolly black lanugo coat that is shed without the epidermis starting at about 4-5 weeks and usually lasting several weeks until after the pup is weaned (Reiter et al. 1981). After molting, the newly weaned juvenile’s coat is made up of short hairs like those found on adults and they are counter shaded dark grey above and silver grey below.During the time on land for breeding or molting, Elephant Seals undergo a complete fast (no food or water) and their body weight declines dramatically due to the demands of lactation (females) and defending territories (males) in the breeding season, and growth of new hair and skin during the molt (Champagne et al. 2012). Adult females can lose almost half their mass during lactation, when they take their single pup from birth to weaning in approximately 25 days. The situation is similar for breeding males, which also lose about half their mass while ashore for periods that can exceed three months.Females reach sexual maturity at the age of 3-4 years and males at 7-9 years. Gestation lasts 11.3 months, including a delay of implantation. The annual pregnancy rate of mature females is 95%. Longevity is more than 14 years for males and 21 years for females (Condit et al. 2013).Northern Elephant Seals are highly polygynous, but not strictly territorial. Males compete for access to females by ranking themselves in a hierarchy. There is much male-male fighting, vocalizing, and displaying during the breeding season, when bulls may be ashore for months at a time (LeBeouf 1972). One of the most impressive displays occurs when a male rears up on his hindquarters, thrusts one half to two-thirds of his body upward and produces a distinctive clap threat vocalization as a challenge to other bulls. The sound is a rolling, resonant, metallic-sounding series of backfire-like sounds punctuated with pauses (Sanvito and Galimberti 2003).Females give birth within a few days of coming ashore, from late December to March. They have a throaty sputtering growl, made with the mouth wide-open, which is used as threat signal. Females and pups have a warbling scream that they use to call to each other, and in the case of the pup, to notify its mother when it is disturbed (LeBeouf 1972). Mother and pup form a strong bond immediately after birth, and females aggressively bite other pups that approach them, occasionally killing them with bites to the head (LeBeouf 1972). However, bulls are a greater source of pup mortality as they regularly crush pups when they charge through aggregations of mothers and pups to chase off or fight encroaching males, or when approaching females for mating. Occasionally, bulls suffocate pups by stopping on top of them and not moving again soon enough (Spraker et al. 2014).Northern Elephant Seals are one of the deepest and longest diving marine mammals. Time-depth recording devices have documented dives deeper than 1,700 m and as long as 109 minutes by adult females. Rest intervals at the surface are usually short, lasting only several minutes between dives that have an average duration of 23 minutes and depth of 520 m (Robinson et al. 2012). After leaving the rookeries, most Elephant Seals spend 80-90% of their time underwater, helping explain why they are infrequently seen at sea.The diet of Northern Elephant Seals is largely unknown due to difficulties associated with identifying prey for such a wide-ranging species. Observations based on scat and stomach content analysis of animals on land have identified squid and mesopelagic fish as the main items consumed. New evidence from animals sampled at the Año Nuevo colony (northern California) on diet composition from biochemical techniques indicates that adult females are eating approximately 51% squid, 23% myctophids, and other mesopelagic fish (C. Goetsch pers. comm.).Great White Sharks and Killer Whales are predators on Northern Elephant Seals (Jefferson et al. 1981). Recent work at the rookeries has revealed that large Great White Sharks aggregate around these sites when Elephant Seals return to haul out (Klimley et al. 2001). Seals that swim at or near the surface as they are approaching or departing the islands are particularly vulnerable to ambush attacks by fast-rising sharks that patrol near the bottom in waters 7-10 meters deep.","Incidental take of Northern Elephant Seals does occur in a variety of coastal net fisheries, but at low levels. This is assumed to be because they move offshore rapidly after leaving colonies to minimize their risk of predation. Anecdotal information points out to an increase in the number individuals observed entangled on land, perhaps as a consequence of the overlap between their at-sea foraging range and the “North Pacific garbage patch”. Some of the lesions caused by these entanglements could lead to the death of individuals, but there are no data on the rate of animals entangled and their survival. Most of the prey of the Northern Elephant Seal is either of low or no commercial fishery value. If the population continues to expand there will likely be new rookeries on mainland beaches, and there will be additional challenges to keep conflicts with humans and domestic and feral animals to a minimum. The risk of transfer of diseases, such as morbillivirus from domestic animals to Northern Elephant Seals, is unknown, but the species is considered to be one of several pinnipeds at high risk of disease outbreaks because of their rapidly expanding population and environmental changes associated with global warming (Lavigne and Schmitz 1990). Tourism at several mainland locations in the United States is extremely popular but highly regulated and is not considered a major threat to the species. Tourist access to nearly all of  the islands occupied by Elephant Seals is controlled by law or otherwise regulated in the United States and Mexico, although a number of Mexican islands are inhabited either year round or most of the year by fishermen and their families.As the species has now recovered from a very small number of survivors, it has likely lost a considerable amount of diversity from passing through this genetic bottleneck, and may now be at greater risk from disease outbreaks and environmental change.","Northern Elephant Seals were a prime target for commercial sealing, and the population was nearly extirpated by hunting during 1818-1869. Due to their pelagic nature, the fact that most animals spend 80% or more of their lives at sea, and that they do all not return to their rookeries at the same time, a few individuals were able to survive the wholesale slaughters at rookery sites. By 1890 only one group of about 100 animals was known to exist (Bartholomew and Hubbs 1990). Following a slow recovery in the early 1900s, Northern Elephant Seals recolonized formerly used sites throughout the 1980s. The total population size in 2010 was estimated to be between 210,000 and 239,000 animals (Lowry et al. 2014). Information for the population in Mexico needs to be updated, but at least for US waters most of the growth in population size has been associated with an increase in the size and number of rookeries in southern California’s Channel Islands. At rookeries in the USA, the population grew at a rate of 17% per year during 1958-1987, slowing to a growth rate of 3.8% per year during 1988-2010 (Lowry et al. 2014).",Increasing,"Northern Elephant Seals are a wide ranging pelagic species that occurs throughout most of the eastern Pacific Ocean north of the 27°N latitude, from the coast of Baja California to the Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, westward to about the International Dateline (180° longitude) (Le Boeuf et al. 2000, Robinson et al. 2012). Breeding takes place on offshore islands and at a few mainland localities from central Baja California, Mexico, to Northern California, USA. The species breeds at over 15 discrete locations, of which a dozen are well-known and occur mostly on islands of southern California and Baja California (Lowry et al. 2014). A few pups are born in Oregon, Washington, and southern British Columbia.Adult Northern Elephant Seals migrate to and from their rookeries twice a year, returning once to breed during December-March and again later in the year (April-August) for several weeks to molt, at different times depending on sex and age (LeBeouf et al. 2000). They also show up at additional coastal sites as far north as southern Oregon for molting. Their post-breeding and post-molt migrations take most females north and west to oceanic areas of the North Pacific and Gulf of Alaska twice a year (LeBeouf et al. 2000, Robinson et al. 2012). Adult males, on the other hand, tend to occupy the shelf break along the Aleutian Islands. Few movement data are available for younger age classes and consequently their at-sea distribution is poorly known. Vagrants have been documented in Japan and at the Midway Islands.","The Northern Elephant Seal was heavily exploited for its oil during 1818-1869, after which it was commercially extinct (Bartholomew and Hubbs 1960). Few animals remained and in the 1900s they were completely protected by both Mexico and the U.S.",Terrestrial|Marine,"In the USA, Northern Elephant Seals are fully protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

However recent estimates are lacking, including for the largest subpopulation. Global abundance is inferred to have been stable or to have increased over the past three generations. While 50% of pup production is estimated to take place at South Georgia, four other sites each support more than 5% of global pup production. Three of those sites have experienced decreases over the past three generations that are not fully understood. While decreases have ceased at two of these sites, they continue at a third. In the light of the unknown effects of global climate change on this species, and the age of estimates of abundance for some subpopulations, demographic monitoring is imperative. This species continues to qualify for listing by IUCN as Least Concern.","Southern Elephant Seals are the largest of all pinnipeds with adult males reaching masses of two to four tons and lengths of up to 4.5 m. They show considerable sexual dimorphism, with adult females only reaching masses of 400-900 kg and average lengths of 2.8 m. Newborn pups weigh between 40 and 46 kg (Laws 1993). Females first haul out to pup at ages of three to six years, and males typically breed for the first time at six to ten years of age (Laws 1956, Carrick et al. 1962a, Jones 1981, McCann 1981, Pistorius et al. 2001, Kirkman et al. 2004). At Marion Island, less than 5% of females survived beyond 13 years of age, and less than 5% of males beyond 10 years of age (de Bruyn 2009). Longevity of 23 years has been recorded for adult females at Macquarie Island (Hindell and Little 1988).Southern Elephant Seals undergo an annual double migration between foraging grounds and isolated haulout sites, at which they are born and where they breed in the austral spring, moult in the austral summer, and as immatures haulout in the winter (Bartholomew and Hubbs 1960, Carrick et al. 1962b, Hindell and Burton 1988). Southern Elephant Seals are predominantly marine. Adult females spend more than 85% of each year at sea while adult males spend less than 80% (Carrick et al. 1962a, Hindell and Burton 1988, McIntyre et al. 2010). Their foraging grounds may be located over 5,000 km from their terrestrial haulout sites (Bester and Pansegrouw 1992, Jonker and Bester 1998, Campagna et al. 1999, Bailleul et al. 2007).Southern Elephant Seals spend most of their at-sea time foraging in association with frontal systems, currents and shifting marginal ice-edge zones. Studies of foraging sites suggest that they are sensitive to fine-scale variation in bathymetry and ocean properties (sea-ice concentration and sea temperature profiles) (Bailleul et al. 2007, Biuw et al. 2010). Southern Elephant Seals are prodigious divers. Dive depth and duration vary during the year and between the sexes, but mostly range from 200 to 700 m deep and from 20 to just over 30 minutes in duration (Biuw et al. 2010, McIntyre et al. 2010). Both sexes spend over 65% of their lives below 100 m. The maximum record dive depth is 2,133 m for an adult male (McIntyre et al. 2010).The diet varies between populations and seasons. It consist primarily of myctophid and notothenid fish and squid (Brown et al. 1999, Piatkowski et al. 2002, Bradshaw et al. 2003, van den Hoff et al. 2003, Cherel et al. 2008, Newland et al. 2011).Four types of terrestrial periods are experienced over the course of their lives: the breeding, moult and winter haulouts, and the natal terrestrial period. The mating system is mate-defense polygyny. Breeding seasons are highly synchronized (Carrick et al. 1962b, Laws 1956, McCann 1981, Bonner 1989). Adult females spend approximately a month ashore during the breeding season, while adult males may spend one to three months ashore. During this time adult females will haul out in large aggregations that may contain up to a thousand animals (Carrick et al. 1962a, Bonner 1989). Some three to seven days after females come ashore they give birth to a single pup, which they will suckle for some three weeks. Mating takes place shortly before the pup is weaned and the adult female returns to the sea a few days later. Breeding aggregations are ephemeral, and do not last beyond the breeding season. Access to all females in one breeding aggregation is defended by a dominant adult male. In larger breeding aggregations, subdominant males also gain access to females (Laws 1956, Carrick et al. 1962a, McCann 1981).Killer Whales are the primary predators of Southern Elephant Seals (Reisinger et al. 2011) but Leopard Seals are also known to take pups (Gwyn 1953).","Southern Elephant Seals face few threats and conflicts today, since they live far from human population centres and have minimal interactions with commercial fisheries. Intensive fishing could, however, deplete important prey stocks (Hanchet et al. 2003). The possible effects of global climate change on Southern Elephant Seals are not well known but such changes may negatively impact prey populations or change marine habitat (Learmonth et al. 2006, Kovacs et al. 2012). It is also possible that a reduction in sea ice due to climate change may benefit Southern Elephant Seals (van den Hoff et al. 2014). Southern Elephant Seals that haul out at mainland sites could come in contact with domestic and wild animals and be exposed to a variety of diseases including morbilliviruses (Lavigne and Schmitz 1990).","No recent comprehensive estimate of Southern Elephant Seal abundance is available throughout the entire distribution. The worldwide population was estimated to be 650,000 in the mid 1990s (SCAR EGS 2008). Four distinct populations have been identified in the Southern Ocean (Gales et al. 1989, Hoelzel et al. 1993, Slade et al. 1998). While the movement of breeding individuals between these populations is rare, it does occur (Fabiani et al. 2003, Reisinger and Bester 2010). These populations include subpopulations at or close to Argentina (Peninsula Valdés and the Falkland Islands), in the Atlantic sector (South Georgia, South Orkney Islands, South Shetland Islands, Bouvetøya and Gough Island), in the Indian sector (Iles Kerguelen, Iles Crozet, Heard Island and the Prince Edward Islands) and in the Pacific sector (Macquarie Island, Campbell Island and Antipodes Island). A further four historical populations are extinct, likely due to exploitation: St. Helena Island, Tristan da Cunha, Islas Juan Fernández and the Bass Strait (Bester 1980, Carrick and Ingham 1962, Wace and Holdgate 1976). A subpopulation from Victoria Land on the Antarctic coast became extinct a few hundred years prior to human discovery (Hall et al. 2006).While Southern Elephant Seals breed at 14 islands or island groups, five of these are responsible for 99% of pup production. More than 50% of pup production takes place at South Georgia (Boyd et al. 1996, M. Fedak pers. comm. in SCAR EGS 2008), with Isle Kerguelen responsible for some 21% (Authier et al. 2011) and the Peninsula Valdes, Heard Island and Macquarie Island each responsible for greater than 5% (Lewis et al. 1998, Slip and Burton 1999, van den Hoff et al. 2014).The Peninsula Valdes/Falkland Island colonies have increased in recent times (Lewis et al. 1998, Galimberti et al. 2001, SCAR EGS 2008). Colonies in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean are also growing or stable (Boyd et al. 1996, Galimberti et al. 2001, SCAR EGS 2008, Gil-Delgado et al. 2013). In contrast, those in the Indian Ocean (Guinet et al. 1999, Slip and Burton 1999, Pistorius et al. 2004, Bester and Hofmeyr 2005, de Bruyn 2009, Pistorius et al. 2011) and Pacific Ocean (van den Hoff et al. 2007, 2014) sectors have been either stable or decreasing to the mid 1990s. However, recent cessations of decrease, and increases, have been recorded at island groups in the Indian Ocean sector (McMahon et al. 2009, Authier et al. 2011, Pistorius et al. 2011). This is not true for the Macquarie Island subpopulation, the only substantial population within the Pacific sector (van den Hoff et al. 2014). Numbers of adult females in this subpopulation declined at a mean annual rate of -0.8% between 1988 and 2011, and continued to do so through 2014.The causes of these declines are debated. They are not completely understood and may differ between populations but evidence indicates that the low survival of adult females (Pistorius et al. 2004, de Bruyn 2009, Pistorius et al. 2011, van den Hoff et al. 2014) or of pups (McMahon and Burton 2005, McMahon et al. 2005ab) is important. Survival of both adult females (Pistorius et al. 2011, van den Hoff et al. 2014) and pups (McMahon and Burton 2005, McMahon et al. 2005b) varies interannually with climatic conditions. The low survival of adult females may be due to the effects of the limitation of food on an age and sex class that is responsible for successfully weaning offspring, and migrating to distant foraging grounds to recover from terrestrial fasts (Pistorius et al. 2011, van den Hoff et al. 2014) whereas the low survival of pups may be due to low weaning mass and also reduced food availability to naïve, and therefore vulnerable, animals (McMahon et al. 2003, 2005a).Generation length has been calculated at 9.5 years (Pacifici et al. 2013). Population change over three generations from 1982–2009 is inferred to have been stable or positive (SCAR EGS 2008, Authier 2011, Pistorius et al. 2011, van den Hoff 2014).",Stable,"Southern Elephant Seals have a nearly circumpolar distribution in the Southern Ocean. While most haulout sites are on Subantarctic and Antarctic islands, a number of animals haul out regularly at sites on the coasts of southern Argentina and Chile (Campagna and Lewis 1992) and Antarctica (Bester 1988, Heimark and Heimark 1986, Murray 1981). They forage at sea between about 40° south and the Antarctic Continent. Occasional vagrants have been recorded on the coasts of northern South America (Alava and Carvajal 2005, De Moura et al. 2010), southern Africa (Kettlewell and Rand 1955, Oosthuizen et al. 1988), Australia and New Zealand (Mills et al. 1977, Taylor and Taylor 1989). The most distant vagrant was recorded at Oman on the Arabian Peninsula, some 9,000 km from the nearest possible point of origin (Johnson 1990).","Southern Elephant Seals were hunted for thousands of years by aboriginal and native peoples in Australia and South America. More recently, they were subject to intensive commercial harvests starting in the early 19th century and not ending until 1964 at South Georgia (McCann 1985). They were prized for their large quantity of blubber that could be rendered to fine, valuable oil (Laws 1960). The commercial harvesting of Southern Elephant Seals ceased in 1964 and they have not been subject to exploitation since (McCann 1985).",Terrestrial|Marine,"Any future exploitation of Southern Elephant Seals within the Antarctic Treaty area (south of 60°S) is regulated by the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals, while north of this area the Convention on Antarctic Marine Living Resources and various national measures apply to the islands and continental areas on which the species breeds and occurs. The Falkland Islands Dependencies Conservation Ordinance provides protection for Southern Elephant Seals on South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (Reijnders et al. 1993). Seals on the Prince Edward Islands are protected by virtue of these islands status as a special nature reserve, their location within a marine protected area, and also by the South African Seabirds and Seals Protection Act (PEIMP 2010).",Afrotropical|Antarctic|Australasian|Neotropical,,false,false,Global
45227978,13654,Neomonachus schauinslandi,Endangered,C1,2015,2014-11-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Hawaiian Monk Seal population was observed to decline from 1,520 total individuals in 1983 to 1,209 in 2011. The number of mature individuals in the entire population in 2011 was 632, a reduction of 20.4% from the 795 mature individuals in 1983. Currently the species is still in overall decline with two distinct trajectories between the populations in the NWHI (4.0% per year decline) and the MHI (6.5% per year increase; Caretta et al. 2013). The NWHI decline is mainly due to food limitation that could be due to changes in oceanographic conditions, legacy impacts of fisheries, or competition with other predators. The overall decline of more than 20% within two generations (30 years) meets IUCN criterion C1 for Endangered.","Adult Hawaiian Monk Seals reach lengths of about 2.1 to 2.4 m and weigh 170-240 kg. Pups are about 1 m and 16-18 kg at birth and when weaned six weeks later they weigh 50-100 kg (Kenyon 1981, Antonelis et al. 2003).Female Monk Seals first give birth at 4-10 years old. Births occur during all months of the year, with most occurring during March to August (Johanos et al. 1994). Age specific fecundity rates for mature animals range from 50% to over 80%, and differ among subpopulations (Harting et al. 2007, Baker et al. 2011). Males in this polygynous species patrol the water adjacent to rookeries or land near females with pups. Male dominated sex ratios have occurred at some colonies, and that has resulted in mobbing of oestrus females some of which have been severely injured or killed in such events (Johanos et al. 2010).Monk seals are generally solitary, both on land and at sea. Even when seals gather together on land, they are not normally gregarious and only mothers and pups and recently weaned seals regularly make physical contact. On land, Hawaiian Monk Seals haul-out and breed on substrates of sand, coral, or volcanic rock. Sandy beaches with shallow protected water near shore appear to be preferred for pupping (Westlake and Gilmartin 1990).At-sea movements and habitat use of Hawaiian Monk Seals have been investigated using satellite-linked dive recorders and animal-borne video cameras. In the NWHI, Monk Seals forage within atolls, in the shallow waters surrounding atolls and islands, and farther offshore at submerged banks and reefs (Stewart et al. 2006). In the MHI, Monk Seals tend to stay within 50 km of shore and forage almost entirely within the 200 m bathymetric contour of the islands. Seals carrying cameras in both regions searched for and preyed on benthic fish and invertebrates in coral reefs, sand flats, as well as areas of rubble and consolidated bottom material, along areas of transition of benthic habitat types, and also in deepwater coral beds (Parish et al. 2000, 2002; NMFS unpublished data). Most dives that have been recorded have been less than 150 meters deep, although some individuals dived to more than 550 m (Stewart et al. 2006, NMFS unpublished data). Hawaiian Monk Seals are known to eat a variety of fishes, eels, cephalopods, and crustaceans (Goodman-Lowe 1998, Iverson et al. 2011, Cahoon et al. 2013).","Recovery of Hawaiian Monk Seals has been affected to an unknown degree by disturbance from military activities in the NWHI including the alteration, development, and occupation of bases on several key islands that started before World War II (Ragen and Lavigne 1999). However, the military no longer has bases in the area and the vast majority of Monk Seals live where they are isolated from most direct human contact. The only permanent structures remaining in the NWHI are US Fish and Wildlife Service facilities at Tern Island and Midway Atoll, and remnants of former Coast Guard facilities at Kure Atoll. Degradation of these structures, particularly at Tern Island, poses a significant entrapment hazard for Monk Seals. There are also concerns about legacy chemicals and contaminants that were left behind.Current threats to Monk Seals are thoroughly reviewed and analysed in National Marine Fisheries Service (2007). The most crucial threats in the NWHI at this time are: 1) food limitation that could be due to changes in oceanographic conditions, legacy impacts of fisheries, or competition with other predators; 2) entanglement in marine debris, largely fragments of net and line discarded by North Pacific fisheries; 3) predation by sharks, especially on pre-weaned and recently weaned pups; and 4) intraspecific aggression by sub-dominant males. An emerging threat in this region may be the loss of terrestrial habitat due to sea level increases resulting from global warming (Baker et al. 2006). The situation in the MHI is different, with the main threats there being: 1) interactions with commercial and non-commercial fishing gear especially hookings and entanglements in gillnets; 2) possible transmission of diseases from feral animals, domestic pets, and livestock to seals; and 3) intentional killing and harassment.","Hawaiian Monk Seals are distributed throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago. Within the Monk Seal’s range, two regions are often distinguished: the NWHI, comprising eight subpopulations located on remote atolls and small islands, and the MHI, comprising eight large high islands and associated small islets. Seals in the MHI are considered to be a single subpopulation. The status of the Hawaiian Monk Seal is assessed annually and updated by the US National Marine Fisheries Service’s Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center. The most recent reliable abundance estimates, from 2011, were used for this assessment.The generation time for Hawaiian Monk Seals, estimated as the average age of reproducing individuals, is approximately 15 years. The best estimate of the total number of seals of all age classes in 2011 is 1,209. The population is comprised of approximately 632 sexually mature seals with the following distribution across subpopulations: Kure Atoll 58, Midway Atoll 27, Pearl and Hermes Reef 101, Lisianski Island 77, Laysan Island 113, French Frigate Shoals 117,  Necker Island 38, Nihoa Island 43, and the MHI 58 (NMFS unpublished data). The earliest information on Monk Seal abundance comes from 1958 (Kenyon and Rice 1959, Rice 1960). However, those data consisted of beach counts only and did not include an estimate of total population size. In order to compare total abundance over time, we have used an estimate for NWHI abundance in 1983 (Gerrodette 1985) at which time there were negligible numbers of seals known to exist in the MHI. This number is compared to the 2011 estimate for total abundance for both the NWHI and MHI. The total abundance estimate for 1983 was 1,520. In 2011, total range-wide abundance was estimated to be 1,209. Over this 28 year period the number of mature individuals declined by 20.4%, from 795 to 632. Extrapolating this decline pattern across two generations (30 years: 1984-2014) gives an estimated overall decline of 21.8%.Overall, the Monk Seal population is still in decline, but with two distinct trajectories between the populations in the NWHI (4.0% per year decline) and the MHI (6.5% per year increase; Caretta et al. 2013). It is expected that species will continue to decline for at least the next 12 years if trends remain the same. At that point the number of animals in the MHI will surpass that in the NWHI and growth in the MHI will offset losses in the NWHI (NMFS unpublished data).",Decreasing,"Hawaiian Monk Seals occur throughout the Hawaiian Island chain. Their six main reproductive sites are in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) at Kure Atoll, Midway Atoll, Pearl and Hermes Reef, Lisianski Island, Laysan Island, and French Frigate Shoals (National Marine Fisheries Service 2007). While sightings were previously rare in the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI), Monk Seals are now regularly seen there and births have been documented on all of the major islands (Baker and Johanos 2004). Sightings outside of the main range have occurred at Johnston Atoll, Palmyra Atoll, and Wake Island (Ragen and Lavigne 1999).Hawaiian Monk Seals are non-migratory, and tend to remain near the atoll where they were born. However, approximately 10% of seals will relocate temporarily or permanently to other sites in the island chain, and long distance wanderers have been recorded.There are approximately 1,693 km of coastline habitat for Monk Seals in Hawaii (US Census Bureau 2012). However, the terrestrial habitat available for their use in the NWHI is very limited. The total area of emergent land is only about 13.5 km² and only a fraction of that is suitable for use by seals (Ragen and Lavigne 1999).The extent of occurrence for Hawaiian Monk seals is approximately 1,500,000 km² and the area of occupancy is approximately 293,000 km².","",Terrestrial|Marine,"The Hawaiian Monk Seal has been listed as endangered under the US Endangered Species Act since 1976. That law contains a number of provisions to protect the seals and their critical habitat. They are also covered by a general prohibition against unpermitted taking by the US Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1973.Virtually all of the land and waters in the NWHI is included in one or more protected areas (the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands State Marine Refuge, the Kure Atoll State Wildlife Refuge, the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, and the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument) where human activities that could effect the seals or their habitats are either prohibited or strictly controlled.Hawaiian Monk Seals are the focus of one of the most proactive marine mammal recovery programs in the world (Lowry et al. 2011). Historically, the primary focus of the species’ recovery program was to increase survival of juvenile and adult female seals in the NWHI. Important recovery efforts include: 1) cleaning up of marine debris and toxic chemicals; 2) minimizing human activities that could disturb seals hauled out on beaches; 3) mitigation of shark predation of young pups through limited shark removals or pup translocations; 4) removal and translocation of adult males to mitigate mortality associated with male aggression towards juveniles and females; and 5) regulating fisheries to reduce the likelihood of direct and indirect interactions. In spite of these efforts the population has continued to decline, however, the efforts have mitigated some of the severity of that decline.  A recent analysis has shown that up to 30% of the current Monk Seal population is alive today due to the small-scale mitigation efforts targeted towards individual seals over the past 30 years (Harting et al. 2014). Efforts to increase juvenile survival are also being expanded using a variety of translocation strategies. Over the past thirty years, numerous Monk Seal translocations have been conducted with a variety of objectives, including reducing shark predation and conspecific male aggression, stopping human–seal interactions, and taking advantage of different demographic patterns between subpopulations to improve survival. (Baker et al. 2011, 2014).Management agencies are currently developing a vaccination plan to guard against a disease outbreak that could decimate the population. Two viruses, Morbillivirus and West Nile Virus, have been identified as infectious agents with a high risk to Hawaiian Monk Seals. Marine Morbillivirus strains have been recently identified in Hawaii and it considered only a matter of time before West Nile Virus makes it to Hawaii (Kilpatrick et al. 2004, West et al. 2013). Background surveys conducted on Hawaiian Monk Seals show that they remain naïve (no detectable antibodies) to both viruses. The vaccination program could begin as early as 2015.In 2014, a privately funded and managed rehabilitation facility was constructed to support recovery efforts.  This Hawaiian Monk Seal hospital will serve to care for seals from across the archipelago that are sick, injured, emaciated, or otherwise in need of rehabilitation.With the increase of Monk Seals in the main Hawaiian Islands, the recovery program has had to develop a number of strategies to maintain population growth while mitigating human-seal interactions (Lowry et al. 2011).  The program is currently working on strategies to prevent and modify unwanted seal behaviors including fisheries interactions and animals conditioned to interact with people.  A significant component of this work includes community engagement on how to avoid negative wildlife interactions.",Oceanian,,false,false,Global

Their diet is unknown, but may have included eels, lobsters, octopus, and reef fish. Like other true seals, the Caribbean Monk Seal was sluggish on land, and its lack of fear of humans and an unaggressive and curious nature contributed to its demise. They were medium-sized seals, with adult standard lengths of 200-240 cm (Allen 2004). Very little is known about the natural history of  the Caribbean Monk Seal, but related species mature at 4-8 years old, give birth to a single pup (usually annually), and can live to be more than 20 years old.","The only known predators of Caribbean Monk Seals were sharks and humans. Intensive exploitation began with the voyages of Columbus, and continued for centuries afterwards, as the seals were killed for their skins and oil. In more recent years, the seal was also subject to persecution from the fishing industry. This human pressure brought the population to very low numbers, ultimately resulting in extinction of the species (Allen 2004, Hairr 2011).","Caribbean Monk Seals were first discovered by Columbus in 1494, and early records testify to its abundance in several parts of the Caribbean. Population size prior to exploitation has been estimated as 233,000-338,000 (McClenachan and Cooper 2007). Hunting of Caribbean Monk Seals by Europeans for food began with Columbus, and many animals were killed for that reason over the following centuries. In the late 1600s hundreds of seals were killed primarily to be used for oil to lubricate machinery on sugar plantations. Additional animals were taken for public display and killed for museum specimens and other reasons (Hairr 2011). By the late 1880s the species was rare, though the Triangle Keys west of Yucatan remained a stronghold of the species until 1915 when about 200 animals were killed there (The Sixth Extinction Website 2007). The last reliable record from anywhere was of a small colony at Seranilla Bank, a group of tiny coral islands halfway between Jamaica and Honduras, in 1952 (Adams 2004). An aerial survey in 1973 covering much of the species known range did not produce any seal sightings (Kenyon 1977). Vessel surveys of the region in 1980 (Sergeant et al. 1980) and 1984 (LeBoeuf et al. 1986) also  failed to locate any seals. Unconfirmed sightings of Caribbean Monk Seals by local fishermen and divers (see for example Boyd and Stanfield (1998)) almost certainly refer to wandering Hooded Seals that have been positively identified on Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands (Mignucci-Giannoni and Haddow 2001).","","The Caribbean Monk Seal inhabited primarily the Caribbean Sea, northwest to the eastern Gulf of Mexico. It had been recorded from numerous islands reefs and cays, including the Bahamas and Greater and Lesser Antilles, as well as the Yucatan Peninsula and southeast along the Central and South American coasts as far east as Guyana. The northernmost extralimital record is from Georgia in the southeastern United States (Allen 2004). Prior to exploitation the species is thought to have occurred in 13-14 colonies spread throughout the Caribbean region (McClenachan and Cooper 2007).",The species was hunted in the past but has been extinct since 1952 so there has been no use since then.,Terrestrial|Marine,"The first legal protection for Caribbean Monk Seals came in 1945 with the Jamaican Wild  Life Law.

There is no indication of a declining trend in the population. However, abundance estimates are somewhat dated and have considerable uncertainty around them and therefore, the population trend is unknown. Ross Seals depend on sea ice for reproduction and at some time in the future they could be adversely affected by a reduction in sea ice due to continued climate warming. The Ross Seal is a widespread and abundant species that does not qualify for any of the IUCN threatened categories, thus they should be listed as Least Concern.","At maturity, Ross Seals are the smallest of the four Antarctic phocids. Based on a small sample of measured animals, Ross Seal males reach 1.68-2.09 m in length and 129-216 kg and females are slightly larger at 1.96-2.5 m in length and 159-204 kg. It is estimated that pups are about one metre and 16 kg at birth; eight suckling pups examined in November were 109-138 cm in length and 40-75 kg. Age at sexual maturity is thought to be three to four years for females and two to seven years for males (Ray 1981). Adults reach final body size at approximately nine years of age and can live to at least 20 years (Skinner and Klages 1994).Most pups are born in November, with a peak from early to mid-November (Southwell et al. 2003). Weaning takes place at about one month of age, although little is known of the relationship between mother and pup. Nursing pups have been seen swimming between ice floes so they appear to be aquatic to some degree. Mating is thought to occur in the water, but has not been observed. Although this species has been presumed to be polygynous, genetic studies do not support this hypothesis and indicate a monogamous mating system (Curtis et al. 2011). Moulting is believed to occur in January, at which time many Ross Seals appear to fast (Skinner and Klages 1994), and moulting seals can form large aggregations on ice floes. During summer Ross Seals exhibit a diel haulout pattern with most seals hauled out on the ice at midday (Ray 1981, Bengtson and Stewart 1997, Southwell 2003). Satellite tracking suggests that Ross Seals are pelagic foragers, spending months in the open ocean foraging in association with the Antarctic Polar Front  and returning to the pack-ice to breed in October-November (Blix and Nordøy 2007).Recent work using electronic devices to monitor at-sea behaviour of Ross Seals has revealed that the species dives continuously throughout the day (average of 108 dives per day), frequently reaching depths of 100–300 m, and displays a clear diel pattern in their diving depth. The deepest dive recorded for the species was 792 m, while the longest dives were over 30 minutes in duration (Blix and Nordøy 2007). The diet of Ross Seals is largely unknown, but the limited available data indicate that they eat mostly squid, with lesser amounts of fish and some invertebrates including krill (Ray 1981, Southwell et al. 2012). Skinner and Klages (1994) identified only Antarctic Silverfish (Pleurogramma antarcticum) in 20 animals examined; no other fish were present. Several species of squid were also recorded in this latter study, but many stomachs were empty when the animals were collected in January, suggesting that this species eats little or fasts entirely during the post-breeding moult period.Killer Whales and Leopard Seals are presumed to be predators of the Ross Seal.","Ross Seals are typically found hauled out in dense consolidated pack ice and can usually only be reached by icebreakers. Small numbers of animals have been collected for commercial purposes, scientific studies and museums, but otherwise interactions with humans have been few. When wandering outside the pack ice zone, Ross Seals could come in contact with commercial fishing operations, but there are no reports of interactions to date.Ross Seals have antibodies to phocine herpesvirus confirming some exposure, but in the only available study they did not have antibodies to Trichinella, Toxoplasma, or phocine distemper virus (Tryland et al. 2012).Our very limited knowledge about the species makes it difficult to make any projections about how global climate change might affect the Ross Seal. However, Learmonth et al. (2006) suggest that Ross Seal numbers may decline with increasing temperatures if Antarctic sea ice is significantly reduced. Siniff et al. (2008) suggest that they will be among the least impacted of the Antarctic seals because they do not feed in sea-ice covered areas. Climate change will affect them when loss of sufficient areas of consolidated ice habitat used for pupping, resting, and avoidance of predators comes to a critical level. Further, due to their pelagic nature, reductions of sea ice would imply longer travel distances to reach their preferred foraging areas. The effects of loss of large amounts of ice on the Antarctic continent, general climate warming, or sea level rises on Antarctic Ocean circulation and productivity and on Antarctic marine resources such as seals are largely unknown.","Ross Seals typically haul out in dense consolidated pack ice and are spread over large geographic areas. As these areas can usually only be reached by ice-breaking ships or long-range aircraft, it is difficult to estimate population size and trend with high certainty. Published global population estimates range from 20,000-50,000 (Scheffer 1958) up to 220,000 animals (Gilbert and Erickson 1977). However, early estimates were based on very limited sampling and were highly speculative. Analysis of ship and aerial sighting surveys carried out around the Antarctic Continent between 1968 and 1983 provided an estimate for the global population of Ross Seals in the pelagic pack ice of the Southern Ocean in the order of 130,000 animals (Erickson and Hanson 1990). No indication of the uncertainty around that estimate was given. The most ambitious and coordinated effort to determine abundance of this species to date was the Antarctic Pack-Ice Seal (APIS) project which conducted aerial and shipboard surveys around the continent during 1996-2001. This international programme also included deployment of satellite-linked dive recorders to investigate haulout behaviour. APIS surveys resulted in an estimate of 78,500 (95% CL 39,400-231,200) Ross Seals in the surveyed areas (Southwell et al. 2012). Given the uncertainty in the estimates, only gross changes in Ross Seal population size could be confidently detected from repeated surveys (Southwell et al. 2008). New data from genetic studies estimating the effective population size of the species indicate a larger population size for the Ross Seal than that estimated using traditional population size surveys (Curtis et al. 2011), but those methods have not been rigorously tested.",Unknown,"Ross Seals have a circumpolar distribution in Southern Ocean waters surrounding Antarctica. In the summer, they are usually seen in dense consolidated pack ice where they haul out to breed, moult and rest. Satellite tracking suggests that Ross Seals spend several months each year foraging in the open ocean in association with the Antarctic Polar Front (Blix and Nordøy 2007). Vagrants have been reported from many sub-Antarctic islands including the South Sandwich Islands, the South Orknies, and Falkland, Scott, Kerguelen and Heard Islands, as well as from southern Australia (Rice 1998, Thomas 2002).",This species is not used at present.,Terrestrial|Marine,"Ross seals are protected by the Antarctic Treaty and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals, and are not listed as threatened or endangered on any national Red List.",Antarctic,,false,false,Global

Trend in abundance is unknown for four of the subspecies; the Eastern Pacific Harbor Seal is known to be increasing. While in many areas Harbor Seals share the coastal zone with increasing human populations and suffer some impacts as a result, current threats appear to be tolerable and/or manageable. As a species, the Harbor Seal does not meet any IUCN criteria for a threatened listing and is listed as Least Concern. However, the subspecies Phoca vitulina mellonae, the Ungava Seal, is listed separately as Endangered.","Harbor Seals live mostly in the coastal waters of the continental shelf and slope, and are commonly found in bays, rivers, estuaries, and intertidal areas. They also occur in some lakes (Burns 2009). They will haul out on rocks, sand and shingle beaches, sand bars, mud flats, vegetation, sea ice, glacial ice and a variety of man-made structures. They usually lie close to the water to permit a rapid escape from threats. Sex and age segregation is common in most populations (Kovacs et al. 1990). They are usually extremely wary and shy on land and therefore it is almost impossible to approach them when they are hauled out without stampeding them into the water. However, habituation to human activities in their vicinity can occur. Most haul-out sites are used daily, based on tidal cycles and other environmental variables, although foraging trips can last for several days (Grellier et al. 1996, Lowry et al. 2001). Although Harbor Seals are considered a non-migratory species with a high degree of site fidelity to a haul out, long-distance dispersal of juveniles, emigration, and establishment of new haul out sites do occur (Ries et al. 1999, Bjorge et al. 2002). There is also evidence of seasonal changes in at-sea distribution and home range size by age class and sex (Lowry et al. 2001, Dietz et al. 2013).Adult male Harbor Seals are 1.6-1.9 m long and weigh 70-150 kg, adult females are 1.5-1.7 m and 60-110 kg. At birth, pups are 82-98 cm and 8-12 kg (Burns 2009). Males become sexually mature when four to six years old. Female Harbor Seals usually become sexually mature when three to five years old (Harkonen and Heide-Jorgensen 1990). Throughout the Harbor Seal's range, the time of birthing varies widely and may follow a latitudinal cline (Temte 1994). Peak pupping date varies from mid March to early September. The mating system is promiscuous, or weakly polygynous, with males defending underwater calling sites (Boness et al. 2006, Van Parijs and Kovacs 2002). Mating usually takes place in the water, with females coming into oestrus about a month after giving birth. Molt follows the pupping and mating season. The timing of onset of molt depends on the age and sex of the animal with yearlings molting first and adult males last (Reder et al. 2003). Females give birth to a single precocial pup. Most pups shed their silvery gray lanugo coat in the uterus before birth and are born with a juvenile pelage. Exceptions to this include pups born prematurely, and some that are born early in the breeding season (Bowen et al. 1994). Pups usually enter the water soon after birth, and because of tidal inundation at many sites used for birthing, this often occurs within hours (Burns 2009). Pups are suckled for an average of 26 days (Drescher 1979). Unlike Grey Seals, Harbor Seal females need to feed during the lactation period to produce adequate milk for their rapidly growing pup, and as a result they undertake regular feeding trips to sea (Thompson et al. 1994, Bowen et al. 2001).At sea, Harbor Seals are most often seen alone, but they occasionally occur in small groups. Localized aggregations can form in response to feeding opportunities and concentration of prey. Harbor Seals are generalist feeders that take a wide variety of fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans obtained from surface, mid-water, and benthic habitats (e.g., Pitcher 1980, Harkonen 1987, Olesiuk et al. 1990, Pierce et al. 1991). Their diet is highly varied, and animals from different populations and areas show differences, and there is also variation associated with seasonal and interannual changes in the abundance of prey (e.g., Tollit et al. 1997, Thompson et al. 1996). Generally, a few species dominate the diet at any one location and time of year. They are primarily a coastal species with dive depths generally less than 100 m (Tollit et al. 1998), but dives to as much as 480 m have been recorded in Alaska (Frost et al. 2001). Longevity is about 30-35 years with females living longer than males. Known predators include Killer Whales, Great White and Greenland Sharks, and possibly other Shark species, Steller Sea Lions, Walrus, Eagles, Gulls, and Ravens (Burns 2009).","Historically, there have been organized population reduction programs and bounty schemes for Harbor Seals in some range states, largely because of perceived competition with fisheries. Hunting and/or licensed killing to protect fisheries has largely been eliminated but subsistence hunting by Alaska Natives is allowed in the US. In the eastern Atlantic, Harbor Seal population reduction programs date from the early 1980s and 1990s in Iceland and Scotland, respectively (Bowen and Lidgard 2012) and continue at some level today (e.g., Butler et al. 2008). An extermination program at the beginning of the 20th century dramatically depleted Harbor Seals in the Baltic Sea. Quotas for Harbor Seals are set annually in Norway and a bounty is paid to hunters in several regions of the country.Mass die-offs from viral outbreaks have killed thousands of Harbor Seals on both sides of the Atlantic, but most notably in Europe caused by phocine distemper virus (Dietz et al. 1989, Harkonen et al. 2006, Reijnders 1986). Because Harbor Seals haul out on nearshore and coastal mainland sites, they are exposed to terrestrial wild carnivores, pets and feral animals, and waste from human populations that create an increased risk of exposure to communicable diseases. Because many Harbor Seals live and feed in close proximity to large populations of humans they are exposed to, and can accumulate, high levels of industrial and agricultural pollutants (e.g., organochlorines, PCBs, dioxins) that negatively affect reproduction (Reijnders 1986), induce vitamin deficiency (Brouwer et al. 1989), and cause immunosuppression (Ross et al. 1995). Both chronic oil spills and discharges and episodic large-scale spills can cause direct mortality (Frost et al. 1994, 1999; Hoover-Miller et al. 2001) and could have long term impacts on Harbor Seal health and their environment. Noise and other disturbance from offshore oil and gas, and the development of offshore renewable energy such as wind farms, may also affect the foraging behavior and physical condition of Harbor Seals (Hastie et al. 2015, Skeate et al. 2012).Harbor Seals live in coastal areas many of which are heavily fished and this results in entanglement and bycatch issues (see Desportes et al. 2010) Overfishing and environmental variability (including global climate change) may also impact Harbor Seal prey populations.","Available data on Harbor Seal abundance were compiled and reviewed in the 2016 Red List assessments for the five recognized subspecies.Estimates of the number of mature individuals, and population trend, for each of those subspecies were as follows:Eastern Atlantic Harbor Seal--65,000, trend unknownWestern Atlantic Harbor Seal--60,000, trend unknownEastern Pacific Harbor Seal--170,000, increasingKuril Seal--&lt;10,000, trend unknownUngava Seal--50, trend unknownCombining those estimates, the total number of mature Harbor Seals worldwide is about 315,000. Bjorge et al. (2010) estimated the total worldwide population of Harbor Seals as approximately 610,000-640,000. The overall trend in numbers is unknown.",Unknown,"Harbor Seals are one of the most widespread of the pinnipeds. They are found throughout coastal waters of the northern hemisphere, from temperate to polar regions. Five subspecies are recognized: the Eastern Atlantic Harbor Seal occurs in the eastern Atlantic from Brittany to the Barents Sea in northwestern Russia and north to Svalbard, with occasional sightings as far south as northern Portugal, the Western Atlantic Harbor Seal occurs in the western Atlantic from the mid-Atlantic United States to the Canadian Arctic and east to Greenland and Iceland, the Ungava Seal only lives in a few lakes and rivers in northern Quebec, Canada, that drain into Hudson and James Bays, the Eastern Pacific Harbor Seal is found in the eastern Pacific from central Baja California, Mexico to the end of the Alaskan Peninsula and possibly to the eastern Aleutian Islands, and the Kuril Seal ranges from either the end of the Alaskan Peninsula or the eastern Aleutians to the Commander Islands, Kamchatka, and through the Kuril Islands to Hokkaido (Rice 1998).","In the European region, some subsistence harvesting still occurs in Greenland. In Russia, Kuril Seals are listed in the Red Data Book and there is no legal harvest.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Harbor seals at Svalbard are protected under the Norwegian National Red List. Hunting of Harbor Seals in the Baltic Sea was prohibited in 1970 and management of this species in the Baltic Sea and Southern Scandinavian waters is the responsibility of HELCOM. Denmark and Sweden have established Harbor Seal sanctuaries. Neighboring states of the Wadden Sea have signed a trilateral agreement for the management of Harbor Seals. Since 1994, Harbor Seals have been considered vulnerable on the French national Red List. In the United Kingdom, Harbor Seals are protected under the Conservation of Seals Act and the Marine Scotland Act.In the United States the Harbor Seal is protected from all but Alaska Native subsistence hunting by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which also prohibits importation of parts or products from all seals. In Canada, the management of Seals is regulated within the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans though the Fisheries Act and the Marine Mammal Regulations of 1993. Ungava Seals are being considered for designation as “Endangered” by COSEWIC and are listed as “Schedule 3, Special Concern” under Canada’s Species at Risk Act.

45229806,17023,Phoca largha,Least Concern,,2016,2015-06-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,The Spotted Seal is an abundant species and there is no evidence of recent declines in the main part of its range. It is therefore listed as Least Concern.,"In the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk, adult female Spotted Seals usually weigh 65-115 kg and are 151-169 cm long, while adult males weigh 85-110 kg and are 161-176 cm long (Boveng et al. 2009). Maximum reported length was 182 cm for females and 185 cm for males (Tikhomirov 1968).In spring, Spotted Seals give birth to a single pup, typically on the surface of sea ice but in some places on shore, particularly in the Bohai Sea, Peter the Great Bay, the South Kuril Islands, the second Kuril Strait, Utashud Island, and the east coast of Kamchatka (Trukhin 2005). Pups are born in a white lanugo coat that is shed at or before weaning, which occurs about four weeks after birth. At birth pups are 75-92 cm long and weigh 7-12 kg, and they grow to 30 kg or more by weaning (Boveng et al. 2009). Mating occurs after pups are weaned. Spotted Seals are annually monogamous and males defend lactating females on ice floes. Groups composed of a female with her pup and a male, called triads, are common during the breeding season (Quakenbush 1988).In late-spring and summer many Spotted Seals leave the sea ice and haul out on land to rest when they are not foraging. On some haul-out sites in Kamchatka the number of animals on shore may exceed 10,000 individuals (V. Burkanov pers. comm.). As sea ice forms in October-November Spotted Seals again use the ice as their primary feeding and resting habitat (Burkanov 1990; Lowry et al. 1998, 2000). They are generalist feeders that take primarily a variety of fish species (Walleye Pollock, Arctic and Saffron Cod, Rockfish, Herring, Sand Lance, Smelt, Capelin, Eelpout, Salmon, Flatfishes), cephalopods (Squid and Octopus) and crustaceans (Shrimp and Crab) (Burkanov 1990, Quakenbush et al. 2009).Reported predators include Pacific Sleeper Sharks, Killer Whales, Golden Eagles, Steller’s Sea Eagles, Ravens, Gulls, Polar and Brown Bears, Wolves, Arctic Foxes, Walruses and Steller Sea Lions (Quakenbush 1988).","Intensive harvesting of fish in the Okhotsk and Bering seas poses a risk to Spotted Seals, as several of their main prey species are targets of commercial fisheries (Lowry and Frost 1985). Entanglement in commercial fisheries occurs occasionally in Japan and in the Sea of Okhotsk and Bering Sea. Small, organized control kills to limit damage to fisheries regularly occur in Japan (Mizuno et al. 2001, Angliss and Outlaw 2007). In Kamchatka, Spotted Seals sometimes eat fish out of fishing gear and fishermen shoot small numbers in local areas to defend their landings and protect their equipment (V. Burkanov, pers. comm.).Oil and gas development may cause disturbance to and adversely affect the habitat used by Spotted Seals (Reijnders et al. 1993). Oil contamination poses poorly known risks to their populations, but the closely related North Pacific Harbor Seal was impacted by oil spilled from the tanker Exxon Valdez (Frost et al. 1994). The greatest impacts would likely result if spills occurred during the pupping season, if food resources were negatively affected, or if the spill was an event that affected a large area (St. Aubin 1990). A variety of contaminants have been found in Spotted Seals sampled in Alaska but their potential impacts are largely unknown (Quakenbush et al. 2009). Contaminant concerns would be greatest for animals living in the western part of the range where they occur near large population and industrial areas in China, Korea, and Japan.Reduction in late winter and spring sea ice cover as a result of the disrupted, warming climate could be problematic for Spotted Seals as the majority of the population uses pack ice at the southern limit of the ice extent for pupping (e.g., Tynan and DeMaster 1997). Changes to ice characteristics that affect its location, timing, stability, etc. could result in lower survival of Spotted Seal pups. This threat is strongest in the southern parts of the range, the Yellow Sea and Sea of Japan, where ice extent and seasonal persistence time have already been greatly reduced (Boveng et al. 2009). The threat may be mitigated somewhat in the Bering Sea, where a long-term range shift northward would be possible through Bering Strait to the Chukchi Sea, where seasonal formation of suitable ice is projected to occur beyond the current century under the most commonly used global climate models (Boveng et al. 2009). Disruption or alteration of the patterns of primary productivity and abundance of key prey species, either by sea ice loss or ocean acidification could also have detrimental effects on Spotted Seals, though the magnitude and even the direction of impacts are very uncertain (Boveng et al. 2009).","The abundance of Spotted Seals has never been well quantified. Poorly documented estimates suggest a total population size in the 1970s of perhaps 400,000, with 200-250,000 in the Bering-Chukchi Seas and perhaps 170,000 in the Okhotsk Sea (Bigg 1981, Quakenbush 1988). More recent surveys indicate the total number may be in excess of 640,000 individuals, with more than 460,000 in the Bering Sea (Conn et al. 2014), 180,000 in the Sea of Okhotsk (Fedoseev 2000), and about 3,300 in the Yellow Sea and Sea of Japan (Han et al. 2010, Nesterenko and Katin 2009). Surveys have been too irregular and imprecise to measure population trend, but Alaska Native hunters have not reported any notable changes in the availability of Spotted Seals (Boveng et al. 2009, Quakenbush et al. 2009).Maximum longevity is at least 35 years (Quakenbush 1988). Less than a third of females and males become sexually mature by age 3, about two-thirds of both sexes become mature by age 4, and nearly all (i.e., &gt;90%) are sexually mature by age 5 (Tikhomirov 1966, Naito and Nishiwaki 1972, Fedoseev 2000, Boveng et al. 2009).",Unknown,"Spotted Seals breed in the Bering Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, the Sea of Japan, the Yellow Sea, and the Bohia Sea. They are also found outside the breeding season in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, ranging north into the Arctic Ocean to about the edge of the continental shelf, west to about 170°E longitude, and east to the Mackenzie River Delta in Canada (Shaughnessey and Fay 1977, Quakenbush 1988). They inhabit the southern edge of the pack ice from winter to early summer. In late summer and fall, Spotted Seals move into coastal areas, including river mouths. They rarely occur in water depths greater than 200 m (Lowry et al. 2000). They breed mostly on sea ice and haul-out on sea ice when it is available, but they also haul out on beaches and sandbars (Burns 1970; Lowry et al. 1998, 2000). There are several sites along the Asian coast where Spotted Seals breed on small remote islands (e.g., in Peter the Great Gulf, the Kuril Islands, and small islands along east coast of Kamchatka; Burkanov 1988, 1990; Trukhin and Katin 2001; Kostenko et al. 2004; Vertyankin and Nikulin 2004).","Alaska Natives are allowed to take marine mammals for subsistence and creation of handicrafts. Subsistence hunting of Spotted Seals has no doubt occurred since humans first made contact with the species and they remain an important subsistence resource for coastal Alaska Natives in western Alaska (Quakenbush 1988, Allen and Angliss 2014). From the 1960s through the 1980s, the Soviet Union harvested several thousand Spotted Seals each year in both the Okhotsk and Bering seas, mostly from large commercial vessels (Heptner 1996). Commercial harvesting of this species no longer occurs in Russia.",Terrestrial|Marine,"In the United States the Spotted Seal is generally protected from all but subsistence hunting by Alaska Natives under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which also generally prohibits import and export of parts or products from all marine mammals.Commercial harvesting of Spotted Seals from vessels of the Russian Federation ended in 1994. Small scale commercial and subsistence harvests from small boats and land occurs along the Russian Far East coast, but the size of the harvest is relatively small (V. Burkanov pers. comm.).Spotted Seals are listed in the Second Category (II) of the State Key Protected Wildlife List in China, listed as Vulnerable in the China Red Data Book of Endangered Animals, and designated a vulnerable species under the Wildlife Conservation Act of China (Wang 1998). However, as of 2004, no “conservation action, public awareness or education programmes have been carried out for the species in this region” (Won and Yoo 2004).In 2000, Spotted Seals were afforded protected status under the Wildlife Conservation Act of South Korea. Despite this protection, the Liaodong Bay population, shared between China and Korea, has continued to decline (Han et al. 2010).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Average body length reaches 126-129 cm, with a maximum body length of approximately 140 cm (Wilson et al. 2014). Both sexes become sexually mature at about 6 years of age, with most breeding females (74% in a 1974 sample) aged between 8 and 17 years (Popov 1979, 1982). The pregnancy rate for females older than 9 is reported to be as low as 0.2-0.33 (Watanabe et al. 1999, Miyazaki 2002), and Krylov (1990) reports a similar low rate of 0.34 for females aged 10-14 years. Härkönen et al. (2012), acknowledge that the reproductive rate is low in females &gt;20 years old, but suggest that the reproductive rate is &gt;0.5 for females &lt;20 years old taken together as a group. Since females &lt;20 years old make up approximately two-thirds of the population of adult females, they probably drive the overall reproductive rate for the population up to about 0.5. Both Watanabe et al. (1999) and Härkönen et al. (2012) attribute the lower reproductive rates of older females to the effect of long term exposure to organochlorine contaminants in the older animals. Accumulation of contaminants with age has been documented in Caspian seals, but most animals appear to be below thresholds associated with reproductive pathologies (Wilson et al. 2014).Pups are generally born from mid-January to late February on the ice, with a birth weight of around 5 kg (Popov 1979), and are nursed for 4-5 weeks. In contrast to ringed seals, females do not usually construct lairs (Frost and Lowry 1981), possibly because sufficient amounts of snow overlying the ice are normally lacking. Pupping on the ice without lairs has allowed direct counts of pups to be made in the recent aerial surveys (Härkönen et al. 2008, Dmitrieva et al. 2015). Pups do not enter the water until the ice melts in mid to late March.The first documented observations of small numbers of Seals breeding in other parts of the Caspian were made in 1982, with females reported pupping on small sand islands in the southern part of the Caspian Sea, although it is likely this behaviour was not new (Krylov 1990). Large numbers of mostly nonbreeding Seals spend the winter in the middle and southern Caspian, with one estimate of 15,000 Seals along the Turkmenistan coast (Krylov 1990).A post-breeding moult occurs from April to early May, during which the Seals first use the ice and then islands, sand bars, and reed beds for hauling out (Badamshin 1970, Krylov 1990). Presently, Komsomolets Bay and the Durnev Islands in Kazakhstan and Malyj Zhemchuzhnyj island in Russian waters represent the most important moulting habitats (Dmitrieva 2013). Aggregations of several tens of thousands of individuals can be found in Komsomoletz Bay during this period, and around ten thousand at Malyj Zhemchuzhnyj.During late spring, summer, and early autumn, Caspian Seals are distributed throughout the Caspian Sea. They feed throughout the region, exploiting both the shallow basin in the north and the deep middle and southern basins (Krylov 1990). Recent satellite telemetry studies indicate about 60% of animals move to the middle and southern Caspian, with the remainder staying in the north, primarily around the inflow of Volga and Ural rivers (Dmitrieva 2013). The telemetry studies suggest considerable individual variation in summer migratory and foraging behavior, with individuals spending the summer period separated among shallow, intermediate, and deep water locations. This may reflect individual specialization or niche partitioning in relation to habitat or prey types (Dmitrieva et al. 2015a). During the post-moult summer period Seals rarely haul out, spending several months at sea feeding. In late autumn the breeding adults gather in the northeast, hauling out on sandy islands and reed beds in increasing numbers until ice begins to form (Krylov 1990). When the surface freezes over, females form aggregations on the ice to give birth to their pups, tending to gather along cracks in the ice giving them ready access to the water, although like Ringed Seals they also construct and maintain holes in the ice for water access (Heptner et al. 1996, Härkönen et al. 2008).Diving capacity for Caspian Seals is comparable to other small phocids, with maximum dive depths exceeding 200 m and dive times exceeding 20 minutes, but most dives are typically shallower than 15 m and shorter than 5 minutes. During the summer foraging areas are not limited by proximity to haul out sites, and animals may spend up to six months at sea. Foraging appears to be primarily benthic (Dmitrieva 2013).Caspian Seals feed on a variety of fish species. During the summer and autumn, Seals move to and congregate where prey are abundant, particularly Caspian Kilka (Clupeonella sp.), Caspian Silverside (Atherina mochon), and Caspian Gobies (Gobidae) (Krylov 1990), with Clupeonella species historically making up a major proportion of their total annual diet (Kosarev and Yablonskaya 1994). A report on fish found in the stomachs of Seals in the northern Caspian in 1986-1987 (Piletskii and Krylov 1990) suggested that fish eaten in order of frequency were Roach (Rutilus rutilus), Zander (Lucioperca lucioperca), Gobies (Knipowitschia sp., Neogobius kessleri and Benthophilus sp.), and Bream (Blicca bjoerkna and Abramis brama), followed by C. deliculata and other species. A preliminary study from faecal samples collected on the Apsheron Peninsula in June 2001 and March 2002 suggested that Gobies, Silverside, and shrimp were important constituents of the diet of Seals at those times (Eybatov et al. 2002). New studies of diet in Caspian Seals are required in order to get an accurate picture of current prey in different areas of the Caspian in light of potential changes to the abundance of fish species due to recent ecological changes occurring in the region.","Unsustainable hunting was the main driver of Caspian Seal decline during the 20th century (Härkönen et al. 2012), and human caused mortality continues to be the main ongoing threat to the population. Recently, by-catch of Seals, primarily in illegal Sturgeon fisheries has been identified as a major cause of Seal mortality (Dmitrieva et al. 2013). Based on semi-structured interviews conducted in fishing communities from Dagestan (Russia), Astrakhan region (Russia), and Atyrau region (Kazakhstan), Dmitrieva et al. (2013) documented a minimum by-catch of 1,215 Seals during the 2008-2009 fishing season, 93% of which occurred in illegal Sturgeon fisheries. However, the study sampling reflected less than 10% of the overall poaching activity in the north Caspian, so the actual by-catch is likely to be substantially higher, and to exceed the Potential Biological Removal level (Wade et al. 1998) for the population (Dmitrieva et al. 2013). Moreover, the survey did not cover fisheries in the middle and southern Caspian. Iranian commercial fisheries cause an estimated mortality of 500 Seals annually (Eybatov et al. 2002). Further work is needed to fully quantify Seal by-catch rates throughout the Caspian Sea, and its implications for population demography. Fishermen frequently sell skins and blubber from bycaught Seals.Natural sources of mortality include predation and disease. The primary non-human predators are Wolves (Canis lupus) and Sea Eagles (Haliaeetus spp.). Krylov (1990) estimated that Wolves killed 17-40% of Caspian Seal pups on “some breeding grounds from 1974 to 1976”, while Eagles took less than 1% of pups. The reverse was found during recent aerial surveys (Harkonen et al. 2008, Dmitrieva et al. 2015b). Few Wolves were observed each year between 2005-2012, but up to 3,100 Eagles. Eagles are likely to primarily scavenge afterbirth and dead pups, but may also be capable of killing unaccompanied unweaned pups.Mass mortality events occurred in 1997 and 2000-2001, killing several thousand Seals each time, and have since been attributed to canine distemper virus (CDV). Presence of a hitherto unknown strain of CDV was confirmed in one dead Seal in 1997 (Forsyth et al. 1998), and the same strain was confirmed as the primary cause of death in Seals dying in 2000 in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan (Kennedy et al. 2000, Kuiken et al. 2006). Examination of archived stranding records in Azerbaijan since 1971, show an increased mortality every few years, suggesting the possibility of previous outbreaks of CDV (Wilson et al. 2014). A serology study of archived samples indicated that CDV was present in Caspian Seals in 1993, 1997, and 1998 (Ohashi et al. 2001). There have been no further mass mortalities since 2001, but disease would become a concern should they reoccur.Degradation of the Caspian Sea ecosystem and overexploitation of primary food resources may also be threats to Caspian Seals (Reijnders et al. 1993, Barannik et al. 2004). An invasive of Comb Jellyfish, Mnemiopsis leidyi, arrived in the Caspian Sea via ship ballast water in the Volga-Don Canal in 1999 (Ivanov et al. 2000). Comb Jellyfish consume zooplankton rapidly, leading indirectly to a reduction in fish stocks and a substantial impact on local fisheries. A 70% reduction in commercial landings of three species of Kilka was recorded within three years of the Comb Jellyfish invasion (Kideys et al. 2005). Kilka are thought to be important prey for Caspian Seals in the central and southern parts of the sea, and the invasion of Comb Jellyfish is considered a threat to the Seals (Ivanov et al. 2000, Eybatov et al. 2002). In addition to impacts from Comb Jellyfish, most commercial fisheries in the Caspian are considered to be severely depleted or extinct due to unsustainable fishing practices and/or loss of fish habitats such as spawning grounds (Strukova and Guchgeldiyev 2010). While Caspian Seals are known to feed to on commercially important fish species, commercial catch rates are not necessarily an indicator of prey availability, and Seals have a varied and adaptable diet which includes non-commercial species such as Gobies. To date is has not been possible to make any quantitative assessment on potential impacts from changes in Caspian food webs and Caspian Seal energetics and demography. Dmitrieva et al. (2015) did not find a significant correlation when testing for association between annual pup production and net primary productivity 2005-2012, but a longer time series of surveys is required to achieve adequate statistical power.The Caspian Sea has no outlet and receives most of its input from the Volga, Ural, and other rivers. Contamination of the Volga with lead, copper, zinc, and cadmium has increased dramatically since the mid-1980s, but levels in Seals do not appear to be elevated, with the exception of zinc in some diseased animals that may have suffered homeostatic disturbance of trace metal levels (Anan et al. 2002).Organochlorine levels (principally polycholorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyltricholoethanes (DDTs)) have been assessed for Caspian Seals dying in the 1997-2001 CDV epizootics (Hall et al. 1999; Kajiwara et al. 2002, 2008; Wilson et al. 2014). Most animals were found to have levels below thresholds believed to cause toxic effects in mammals. Overall levels in Caspian Seals were lower than those seen in European Seal species, comparable to Baikal Seals, and higher than those reported for Arctic species (Wilson et al. 2014). Presently there is no evidence that organochlorine burdens in Caspian Seals cause reproductive or immune impairment, or contributed to the 1997-2001 CDV outbreaks at a population level, although some individual Seals may have high burdens (Kuiken et al. 2006, Eybatov et al. 2002, Härkönen et al. 2012, Wilson et al. 2014). Organochlorine accumulation was found to be primarily age related, which means animals at the older end of the age distribution may be at risk of crossing toxicity thresholds towards the end of their reproductive lifespan (Wilson et al. 2014). It has been recommended that levels of persistent organic pollutants should be monitored in the future due to the continuing industrial development around the Caspian region and time elapsed since the last survey following the CDV epizootics (Wilson et al. 2014).Combined juvenile mortality from continued hunting, natural predation, and fisheries by-catch is believed to be unsustainable. Overall mortality before breeding from all sources is likely to be in the region of 50% (Härkönen et al. 2008). Demographic models indicate such a high rate of juvenile mortality would be capable of causing a continuing decline in the Caspian Seal population, with lowered fertility due to organochlorine contamination being a relatively minor factor (Härkönen et al. 2012). Variation in annual pup production determined from aerial surveys makes empirical estimation of current population trends uncertain (Dmitrieva et al. 2015b), and a longer time series is necessary to assess the demographic trajectory directly.As a landlocked ice-breeding species with no option to migrate to alternative habitats, Caspian Seals may be vulnerable to future climate change (Kovacs et al. 2012). Warming may cause a reduction in the spatial extent, temporal duration, and stability of the winter ice breeding habitat. Premature break-up of the ice sheet before pups are moulted will cause significant mortality among pups of the year. January-March 2007 was one of the mildest winters in the Caspian in recent years, with ice cover suitable for breeding limited to a narrow strip along the coastline of the north-east Caspian. Storms in mid-February may have caused ice-flows with large numbers of pups to be swept out to sea, and pup counts for that year were less than one third the maximum observed for 2005-2012 (Dmitrieva et al. 2015b). It has also been suggested that poor ice conditions may play a role in the epidemiology of CDV outbreaks due to Seal crowding on limited haulout space and poor condition of weaned pups (Kuiken et al. 2006). Long term trends in Caspian Sea ice cover and the implications for population demography remain to be fully assessed.Through the geological history of the Caspian, there have been several substantial fluctuations of sea level (Dumont 1998), which will have affected the relative amounts of shallow and deep water habitats available to Seals. The population adapted to those past changes, but there is some concern about whether the same will be possible for future sea level changes given added pressures of habitat loss and human impacts.Further threats to the Seals on shore and on ice now come from increasing disturbance due to offshore and shoreline developments. One of the largest oil fields in the world is currently being developed in the Caspian, with the construction of numerous offshore oil drilling islands, pipelines, shipping access to these, and onshore logistics facilities. A recent study found that breeding Seals are using shipping channels as artificial leads into the ice and are giving birth close to the edge of these channels. A significant proportion of the breeding population and pups may therefore experience disturbance by shipping traffic depending on the ice conditions (Härkönen et al. 2008). More research is required to quantify the likely impacts of this intensive oil development. The coasts of Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Iran have also seen increased development for domestic and leisure use in recent years, with many previously undisturbed stretches of coast now being developed.Disturbance of island and reef haulout sites by illegal fishing activities and opportunistic Seal hunting are another ongoing problem. Recent surveys have found that the Caspian Seal has effectively disappeared from Azerbaijan, with the once important haulout sites of the Apsheron Peninsula and Archipelago abandoned. These sites were used by many thousands of Seals until the 1930s when they were heavily hunted (Krylov 1990). However, between 1997 and 2002 a few hundred Seals were still counted regularly at these sites (e.g., Allchin et al. 1997, Wilson et al. 2014). Few live Seals have been seen in this area since 2004 (Wilson et al. 2014). The overall Caspian Seal population decline since 2002 is unlikely to account for this total disappearance, which is most probably due in part to severe disturbance by illegal fishing and other coastal activities (T. Eybatov, unpublished data). Similar declines in the regularity of Seal occupancy have also been noted recently at other sites, such as South West Island near the Ural Delta and Osushnoy Island (Kazakhstan), Bautino (Kazakhstan), and in Turkmenbashi Bay (Turkmenistan). The number of Seals at Ogurchinsky Island (Turkmenistan) has also declined from several thousand in the 1980s to a few hundred (P. Erokhin, unpublished observations). The only previously recorded haulout site in Iran, at Ashoora Island, is no longer used by Seals (H. Asadi pers. comm.). There is a need to develop an inventory of all haulout sites throughout the Caspian together with archived and current records of Seal occupancy (Wilson and Goodman 2012).","Historically, the population of Caspian Seals was estimated to have exceeded one million (Krylov 1990, Härkönen et al. 2012). The most recent estimates of abundance are based on aerial surveys of the breeding population on the northern ice field conducted annually in February between 2005 and 2012 (Härkönen et al. 2008, Dmitrieva et al. 2015b). During this period estimated annual pup production ranged between 8,200 (95% confidence intervals 7,130-9,342) and 34,000 (95% confidence intervals 31,275-36,814). This would suggest there are currently approximately 68,000 reproductively mature individuals (male and female, based on the greatest observed pup production), with the total population in the region of 104,000 to 168,000 individuals derived from an age structured model (Härkönen et al. 2008, 2012; Dmitrieva et al. 2015b). Variation in weather conditions during surveys may account for some of difference in pup counts between years, but additional contributions from biological factors affecting fecundity cannot be excluded at this time (Dmitrieva et al. 2015b). The variability in annual pup makes the current population trend uncertain, and a longer time series is necessary to directly assess the demographic trajectory (Dmitrieva et al. 2015b). However, if pup mortality exceeds 50% due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic causes (a realistic scenario), this could be sufficient to result in ongoing declines (Härkönen et al. 2012). The population decline throughout the 20th century has been reconstructed by a demographic model using hunting statistics. By the 1950s–1960s, the population was estimated from this model to have been reduced to between 400,000-500,000 Seals (Härkönen et al. 2012), while an estimate based on a harvest of 86,000 pups in 1966, believed to be most pups born that year, also produced an estimate of 500,000 Seals for that year (Krylov 1990). Aerial surveys conducted in 1976 and 1980 suggested an estimate of 450,000 animals (Krylov 1990), although the hind-casting analysis suggests a population of only about 200,000 Seals remaining at that time (Härkönen et al. 2012). Surveys in 1987 and 1989 resulted in an estimate of approximately 360,000-400,000 (Krylov 1990), but again the hind-casting analysis suggests this might again have been an over-estimate, with perhaps only about 130,000 Seals remaining by the late 1980s. Overall, the hind-casting analysis indicated a population reduction of about 66% during 1867-1964 and a further reduction of 73% during 1965-2005 (Härkönen et al. 2012). Härkönen et al. (2012) estimated the total population of adult females as 354,210 in 1945 and 21,000 in 2005, later revised to 34,000 by Dmitrieva et al. (2015b) after accounting for survey observation errors. Although pup production has been revised upwards in more recent publications, this would not affect the relative decline, since it would imply correspondingly higher historical population sizes. The IUCN Criterion A calculator was used to project declines over a three generation period 1955-2015, indicating adult female numbers declined 91.5%. However, the scale of decline is dependent on estimated values for parameters such as pup survival and fertility rates, about which there is some uncertainty (Härkönen et al. 2012). Therefore a more conservative position for the purposes of IUCN classification would be to accept a relative decline of at least 70% until more data are available to refine the historical demography.Generation time from Pacifici et al. (2013) is 18.8 years.",Unknown,"Caspian Seals are confined to the Caspian Sea. They range throughout the sea with seasonal migration between the southern, middle, and northern basins. More than 99.9% of breeding takes place on ice, which covers the shallow northern parts of the Caspian Sea in from late December to early April in typical years (Krylov 1990, Dmitrieva 2013, Dmitrieva et al. 2015a). Occasional observations have been made of low numbers (a few tens of individuals) breeding on islets off Turkmenistan (Krylov 1990, Dmitrieva 2013).","Caspian Seals have been commercially exploited since the late 18th century. Harvests averaged 119,000-174,000 per year throughout the 19th century, with peaks of 300,000 having been recorded. In the 20th century, harvest levels peaked in the 1930s with an average annual harvest of 164,000 and a maximum single year take of 227,600. The numbers of Seals taken fell during World War II to an average of 60,800 per year, and subsequently ranged between a low of 41,400 and a high of 108,300 for the period 1951-1975 (Krylov 1990, Härkönen et al. 2012). Commercial harvesting was temporarily halted in 1996 after a much-reduced estimated take of 14,000 Seals. Since the start of the 21st century smaller scale commercial and scientific hunting has taken place in Russia, typically with recorded hunts of tens or hundreds of individuals per year, with a maximum of 4,600 (in 2003-2004), reported for the period up to 2010. Official hunting is conducted under a quota system administered by an inter-governmental body, the Caspian Bioresources Commission. Typical annual quotas are for 18,000 Seals, with 8,000 allocated to Russia, and the remainder divided among the other Caspian states. The scientific rationale for the quotas is not clear. Currently only Russia actively pursues official hunting under the quota, but large scale hunting does not appear to be commercially viable at present and recorded takes are far below the official quota levels (Härkönen et al. 2012, Dmitrieva et al. 2013). The level of ‘unofficial’ or illegal hunting is poorly documented, but illegal hunting on ice on the scale of hundreds of Seals is known to take place periodically (Dmitrieva et al. 2013). Seal skins are used for hats and other clothing in Russia, while Seal blubber is used as a medicinal tonic, fishing bait, and cattle feed in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. The total economic value and trading networks for Seal products remain to be fully determined, but high quality individual seal skins may sell for up to $100 US dollars at the point of origin, while seal oil can sell for $14.00 per litre in local markets (Dmitrieva et al. 2013).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Various prohibitions, quotas, and protective measures have been taken to conserve the Caspian Seal, beginning in 1940 when seal nets were prohibited. The harvest of moulting Seals in the spring was ended in 1946, and in 1952 the Apsheron Archipelago in Azerbaijan was closed to sealing. Female harvesting on the breeding grounds was stopped in 1966 and all take was prohibited on the eastern islands of the northern Caspian in 1967. These last two changes led to a complete change in the commercial harvest, resulting in a switch to newborn and moulted pups. Quotas on harvest of pups, purportedly based on biological data, began in 1970 (Krylov 1990), although in retrospect the quotas were at unsustainable levels. The Russian Federation continues to consider the Caspian Seal to be a ‘harvested’ species, with quotas set through the Caspian Bioresources Commission (Härkönen et al. 2008, 2012).A Seal Conservation Action and Management Plan was approved by the nations bordering the Caspian Sea, pursuant to the 2003 Framework Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Caspian Sea (Caspian Environment Programme 2007), but it had no legally binding actions. The action plan recommended cessation of hunting, measures to reduce by-catch in legal and illegal fisheries, and the strategic creation of protected areas of sea, ice, and shore. However, to date none of the Caspian states have taken steps to implement the action plan. In 2012 the CaspEco Project, a UNDP funded follow up to the Caspian Environment Programme, published a framework report and road map for the establishment of a network of protected areas for Caspian Seals, including suitable locations (Wilson and Goodman 2012), but no further action has yet taken place. A number of small non-governmental organizations within Caspian countries are involved in producing educational materials and promoting awareness of Caspian Seals. In Iran, localised work with fishing communities has been conducted promoting release rather than killing of live animals found entangled in fishing gear, and a stranded seal rehabilitation facility has been established. In 2014 the Caspian States banned all catching of wild Sturgeon and in recent years Kazakhstan has increased maritime patrols to counter Sturgeon poaching which in principle may have potential to also help reduce seal by-catch.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45230946,41670,Histriophoca fasciata,Least Concern,,2016,2015-06-09 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Despite recent progress in population assessment, estimates of total abundance of Ribbon Seals are imprecise and current population trend is not known. But, with modern assessment methods producing an estimate of nearly 400,000 animals it is evident that the population is quite large. Commercial harvesting of Ribbon Seals stopped in 1994 and numbers have likely been growing since then. The only major threat identified is climate change, and effects of that are not likely to occur in the near future. Ribbon Seals are classified as Least Concern.","Ribbon Seals are medium sized phocids, with a striking pattern of light bands on their darker pelage. Pups at birth are about 86 cm long and weigh about 9.5 kg. Males and females are similar in size with adults typically 150-175 cm long, and weighing 70-90 kg (Tikhomirov 1968, Burns 1981, Fedoseev 2000).Female Ribbon Seals mature when they are 2-4 years old and males when they are 3-5 years. Adult females give birth to a single white-coated pup in March-May that is nursed for 3-4 weeks. Clean, white, broken pack ice is preferred as a birth site over solid ice sheets and ice with sediment or algae. Breeding occurs after the pup is weaned, and gestation lasts about 9 months after 2-2.5 months of delayed implantation. Ribbon Seals generally live to about 20 years old, but maximum longevity may be as much as 30 years (Burns 1981, Boveng et al. 2013).From late winter until summer, Ribbon Seals occupy the pack ice that overlies the continental shelf. They prefer areas of 60-80% ice coverage, rarely use shore fast ice, and do not haul-out on land unless moribund (Kelly 1988, Burns 1981). They typically lie away from the edge of floes and show little concern for the approach of people or vessels. Broken pack ice is preferred over solid ice sheets and highly concentrated pack ice. Their whereabouts when pack ice breaks up or disappears from the Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk is not well known. Kelly (1988) suggested that animals from the Bering Sea population summer in the Chukchi Sea and those from the Sea of Okhotsk, where Ribbon Seals are not seen after mid-July, might move into the southern Bering Sea. Burns (1981) reported that few Ribbon Seals are seen on ice or harvested by Alaska Natives in the Bering Strait and Chukchi Sea after mid-June, and suggested that many Ribbon Seals are probably pelagic during summer and fall, not hauling out on land or ice until the next winter.Satellite-linked tags were applied to more than 80 Ribbon Seals captured in spring 2005-2010 in the ice of the central and western Bering Sea (Boveng et al. 2013). All tagged Seals were pelagic during summer and fall. They ranged widely through the Aleutian Islands, Bering Sea, Bering Strait, Chukchi Sea, and adjacent Arctic Basin. Ribbon Seals from the Okhotsk Sea have not been tagged and tracked.The overall diet of Ribbon Seals is unknown because essentially all the samples that have been examined came from the spring period when the primary activities are pupping, breeding, and molting, and most stomachs are empty. Prey items identified from spring samples included at least 25 species of fishes and 23 species of invertebrates. Commonly occurring prey included Walleye Pollock, Arctic Cod, Pacific Cod, Saffron Cod, Capelin, Smooth Lumpsucker, Eelpout, flatfish, Squids, Octopus, and crustaceans. Crustaceans (Euphausiids and Shrimps) appear to be a main food item for newly weaned and young Seals (Boveng et al. 2013). Using both stomach contents and stable isotope analysis, Dehn et al. (2007) concluded that trophic level of the Ribbon Seal diet increased with age of the Seal, suggesting a diet transition from mostly crustaceans in young animals to fish and nektobenthos in older animals. The only two stomach samples collected in mid-winter contained Walleye Pollock and Arctic Cod (Burns 1981).Dive data provided by satellite-linked tags showed relatively shallow diving (mostly to &lt;100 m) during spring when Seals are over the continental shelf, with deeper diving occasionally to &gt;600 m at other times when the Seals may be over deep basins (Boveng et al. 2013).","Ribbon Seals are sometimes incidentally caught in commercial fisheries, but bycatch data are incomplete. Available data suggest a take of approximately one per year by the Alaska fisheries that were monitored during 1990-2007 (Boveng et al. 2013). Woodley and Lavigne (1991) reported catches of a few up to 14 per year in fisheries around Japan. During seven years (1993-1999) of monitoring the offshore salmon gill net fishery in Russian Far East, incidental mortality of Ribbon Seals was estimated to be 1,079 individuals (154 per year), mostly juveniles (Burkanov and Nikulin 2001). These data certainly underestimate the total take as bycatch is not monitored in a number of Russian and Alaskan fisheries.Commercial fisheries target a number of known Ribbon Seal prey species (e.g., Walleye Pollock, Pacific Cod, Pacific Herring, and Capelin), and it is possible that reductions in prey biomass caused by fishing could have an impact on Seal nutrition. At the current time, biomasses of these fishes are fairly high and stable, at least in the Bering Sea, and impacts of removals on Ribbon Seal nutrition are not likely. This situation could change, however, as fishing patterns shift with warming waters and reduced sea ice (Boveng et al. 2013).As is true for all ice-associated pinnipeds, climate warming and reductions in seasonal sea ice are likely to have impacts on Ribbon Seals. A detailed review of this issue by Boveng et al. (2013) analyzed the possible individual and cumulative effects on Ribbon Seals of future warmer temperatures, reduced ice, ocean acidification, and associated changes in prey, predators, parasites, and diseases. They concluded that while impacts are likely at some point in the future, they are very difficult to predict or quantify.","Three separate populations of Ribbon Seals have been proposed associated with aggregations of breeding animals - the Bering Sea, the southern Sea of Okhotsk, and the northern Sea of Okhotsk (Fedoseev 2002). However, Boveng et al. (2013) considered the biological evidence for separate breeding populations in the Okhotsk and Bering seas to be weak or equivocal, and they assessed the status of Ribbon Seals as a species with a single population.Ribbon Seals are difficult to enumerate, as they are widely dispersed over large areas that are generally far from land. Nonetheless, a number of population estimates have been proposed based on counts made during aerial surveys flown over sea ice in the Bering and Okhotsk seas (see Boveng et al. 2013). In most cases surveys were not designed specifically for Ribbon Seals, and the methods used varied and were often not well described. Burns (1981) reported a population estimate of 90,000-100,000 animals in the Bering Sea, and 140,000 animals in the Okhotsk Sea. Fedoseev (2002) gave an estimate of 120,000 to 140,000 animals for the Bering Sea in 1987 and estimates of between 200,000 (1968-1974) and 630,000 (1988-1990) for the Okhotsk Sea. The Okhotsk Sea population was reported to have averaged 370,000 animals with 320,000 in the central northwestern region and 50,000 in the southern region, in the period between 1968 and 1990 (Fedoseev 2002). Little information was collected on Ribbon Seal abundance between 1991 and 2007. Boveng et al. (2008) used eastern and central Bering Sea survey results from 2007, combined with information on distribution (Fedoseev 1973, Fedoseev et al. 1988), to estimate the range-wide abundance of Ribbon Seals as 267,000. The 95% credible interval for that estimate was 154,000-827,000.American and Russian scientists conducted image-based aerial surveys of ice-associated Seals in the Bering and Okhotsk seas in 2012 and 2013. Data from those surveys are not yet fully analyzed, but using a limited subsample of the data collected from the U.S. portion of the Bering Sea in 2012, Conn et al. (2014) estimated about 184,000 (95% CI: 145,752-230,134) Ribbon Seals in that area. The estimate from the 2013 survey in the Okhotsk Sea was 181,179 (95% CI: 118,392–316,995) Ribbon Seals (Chernook et al. 2014). The mean estimate from the two surveys combined is about 365,000 animals.Population trend is unknown.",Unknown,"Ribbon Seals inhabit the northern North Pacific Ocean and adjoining seas, and are seen most commonly in the Bering and Okhotsk seas hauled out on sea ice in the ice front region. They are seen on ice until it has melted in May-June, and seldom haul out on ice or land until the following spring (Burns 1981). The presumption that they live a pelagic lifestyle during summer and fall has been corroborated by tracking with satellite-linked tags (Boveng et al. 2013). Results from tagging and occasional sightings indicate that during the ice free months they range from Hokkaido and the northern Sea of Japan, eastward through the northern North Pacific and Aleutian Islands to the western Gulf of Alaska, and northward through the Chukchi Sea to the East Siberian Sea, the western Beaufort Sea, and the Arctic Ocean (Moore and Barrowclough 1984, Mizuno et al. 2002, Boveng et al. 2013). Single Ribbon Seals occasionally occur along the coast of North America and Asia outside of their normal range (Boveng et al. 2013), and a debilitated vagrant was found on the beach in Morro Bay, California, and taken into captivity (Roest 1964).","Russian commercial hunting of Ribbon Seals began in the Okhotsk Sea in the 1930s and expanded to an annual harvest of 20,000 in the 1950s (Heptner 1996). The annual harvest averaged 11,000 from the 1950s to 1969 and 5,000-6,000 from 1969-1992 (Fedoseev 2002). Commercial hunting began in the Bering Sea in 1961 with an average annual harvest of 9,000 through 1968, declining to 3,000 to 4,000 per year from 1969 to 1992 (Heptner 1996). Reported harvests did not include the number of animals that were killed but lost which may have amounted to 15-20% (Fedoseev 2000). Commercial hunting from sealing vessels stopped in the Bering Sea in 1991 and in the Okhotsk Sea in 1994 because of economic factors, but substantial quotas were still allocated at least through 2005 (Boveng et al. 2013).Ribbon Seal abundance appears to have declined due to the intensive commercial hunting in the late 1950s and 1960s, but began to rebound after quotas were reduced in 1969 (Burns 1981, Boveng et al. 2013).The number of Ribbon Seals taken by indigenous hunters for subsistence is not well quantified, but harvests are low and almost certainly sustainable (Boveng et al. 2013).",Marine,"Russia stopped large scale commercial harvesting of Ribbon Seals in 1994. Shore-based harvests for subsistence purposes are at very low levels and not likely to be a threat to the population. In the US, Ribbon Seals are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. In 2007, the US National Marine Fisheries Service was petitioned to list the Ribbon Seal as threatened or endangered under the US Endangered Species Act. In 2013 the agency concluded that such a listing was not appropriate at that time (NMFS 2013).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

However, climate change poses a serious threat to this ice-associated species and Harp Seals should be reassessed within a decade. Reductions in pup production and declines in body condition have recently been documented in the Northeast Atlantic breeding groups that are thought to be due to environmental change linked to warmer water and less sea ice.","Harp Seals are medium-sized phocids. Adult males and females are similar in size, about 1.8 m long and weighing about 130 kg. Females reach sexual maturity between four and eight years of age (e.g., Frie et al. 2003), and this has varied considerably over the last century, in part as a consequence of population size that has been largely determined by harvest levels and food availability. Males probably do not participate in breeding until they are somewhat older, though they reach physiological maturity around the same time as females. Birthing takes place in vast herds from late February to April. There is some variation across the range in the precise timing but herds are highly synchronized (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). Pups are born on the open, free-floating, pack ice and nursed for 12 days, during which time they gain weight at about 2.2 kg per day (Kovacs and Lavigne 1985, Kovacs 1987, Kovacs et al. 1991, Lydersen and Kovacs 1996). To minimize energy expenditure, most pups are sedentary for the first month; some are so immobile that they melt into the ice beneath them, forming ice “cradles” (Kovacs 1987). Pups are referred to as “whitecoats” because they are born with an insulating coat of white lanugo. Lactating females spend up to 85% of their time in the water, depending on the weather (Lydersen and Kovacs 1993). Towards the end of lactation, females come into oestrus and mate (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). Weaned pups remain on the ice for up to six weeks, losing up to 50% of their weight before entering the water to feed. During this post-weaning fast they complete moulting of the lanugo. After this coat is shed, the black and silver-gray pelage is exposed and the juveniles are known as “beaters” until they are about a year old. Gestation lasts about 11.5 months, including a three to four month period of delayed implantation (Stewart et al. 1989). The maximum life span of a Harp Seal is approximately 30 years; most animals that reach sexual maturity live to over 20 years. Both males and females are sexually active until the ends of their lives, showing no reproductive senescence (Ronald and Healey 1981). Harp Seals older than pups undergo a moult in the post-breeding months, from early April to early May (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). Harp Seals are highly migratory, and after breeding Canadian Seals follow the pack ice up the coast of Labrador, with small numbers going into Hudson Bay and around Baffin Island, and the rest travelling up both sides of Davis Strait. The Jan Mayen and White Sea groups migrate northward and mix in the Barents Sea (Folkow et al. 2004). The Canadian Seals also spend the summer months in the Arctic; their round-trip migration is over 5,000 km long (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). They begin the return trip to their breeding grounds (either the Gulf or the Front) in late autumn. Harp Seals consume a wide range of prey that varies along their migration routes. Their recorded diet includes 67 species of fish and 70 species of invertebrates (Lavigne 2002). Pups and juveniles take a lot of invertebrate prey, especially Euphausiids (Thyanoessa spp.) and pelagic Amphipods (Parathemisto spp.; Haug et al. 2000, Nilssen et al. 2001). Adults in Greenland eat pelagic crustaceans, and fish such as Capelin (Mallotus villosus), Sandeel (Ammodytes sp.), Polar Cod (Boreogadus saida) and Arctic Cod (Arctogadus glacialis). Commercial species such as Atlantic Cod (Gadus morhua) appear to be of minor importance in the diet (Kapel 2000), largely because Harp Seals of all ages eat relatively small prey and tend to specialize somewhat on polar species such as Polar Cod and Capelin (Lindstrom et al. 2013). In the Barents Sea, Harp Seals eat Amphipods, Shrimps and small fish including Polar Cod, Sculpin (Cottidae), Snailfish (Liparidae) and Capelin (Nilssen et al. 1995); but they show a clear preference for large Polar Cod (Wathne et al. 2000, Lindstrom et al. 2013). The Seals off Newfoundland eat Capelin and Arctic Cod, and off Labrador they eat Arctic Cod and Atlantic Herring (Clupea harengus). In the Gulf of St Lawrence, the Seals consume Capelin, Herring, Atlantic Cod, Arctic Cod and Redfish (Sebastes sp.; Lawson et al. 1995). Harp Seals feed heavily in winter and summer and less in spring and autumn. They are a highly social species that travels and forages in groups, yet they maintain a stratification of diet according to age class and depth of the feeding dives. Harp Seals are relatively shallow divers. Animals satellite-tagged at Jan Mayen stayed close to the edge of the pack ice during the spring moult, usually diving to less than 100 m, but by July tagged Seals in the Barents Sea dove to 400 m. Overall, the deepest dives occurred during the day in winter (Folkow et al. 2004).Natural predators of Harp Seals include Polar Bears, Killer Whales and Greenland Sharks (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). In Svalbard, 13% of Polar Bear prey is comprised of Harp Seals (Derocher et al. 2002).","As noted earlier, Harp Seals have been harvested for thousands of years but currently the population is large and the number of animals harvested is declining.Reduced availability of potential prey, especially Polar Cod, Capelin and Herring, is a threat to Harp Seals. Several Harp Seal “invasions” took place in recent decades along the north coast of Norway. By-catch mortality in nets during those events was estimated to be as high as 100,000 animals in 1987 and 21,474 in 1988 (Haug et al. 1991). The reason for these emigrations out of their normal range within the Barents and Greenland Seas seems to have been a collapse of Herring and Capelin stocks due to a combination of overfishing and shifting oceanographic conditions (low temperatures and salinity, and extensive ice cover; Haug et al. 1991, Woodley and Lavigne 1991). More recently, declining Krill abundance has been correlated with declines in both pup production and body condition of Harp Seals in the Barents Sea region, which are likely related to reductions in sea ice in this area (Øigård et al. 2013). A small tourist industry that visits the whelping patches in the Gulf of St. Lawrence is not thought to pose any risk to the Seals; it uses a rotational mode of operation such that individual Seals are not visited repeatedly (Kovacs and Innes 1990). Oil spills in the Northwest Atlantic off the east coast of Canada remain a threat to Seals. There is a concern about the impacts of tanker traffic, particularly in places like Lancaster Sound in the eastern Canadian Arctic, which is an important Harp Seal summering area (Reijinders et al. 1993). The discharge from a ruptured tank on the shore of New Brunswick, Canada in March–April 1969 led to 10,000 to 15,000 Seals being heavily coated with oil. The high number of dead pups washing ashore after this event was evidence of the lethal effects of the oil (St. Aubin 1990). Oil development in the Barents Sea is ongoing and poses a future threat to Harp Seals in the White Sea and West Ice stocks. Harp Seals have been found to carry significant loads of contaminants including metals, DDT and PCBs (Ronald et al. 1984ab). Organochlorines are still present in their blood, despite DDT levels in the environment (and PCBs to a lesser extent) declining from the early 1970s to the 1980s (Addison et al. 1984) and further in the 1990s and 2000s (Muir and de Wit 2010). Phocine distemper virus (PDV) was first found in Harp Seals from the West Ice off Jan Mayen in 1987 and 1989. It is widespread in Harp Seals, but only shows up as antibodies; it is not known if there are significant health effects or mortality from PDV infection in this species (Daoust et al. 1993, Duignan et al. 1997). Harp Seals might have been the carriers responsible for the Harbour Seal PDV epidemic in Europe in 1988 (Markussen and Have 1992). PDV also appeared Harp Seals in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 1991, but not in epidemic proportions (Daoust et al. 1993). Global climate warming is of notable concern for this species. There have already been major reductions in the extent and seasonal duration of sea ice cover in the Northern Hemisphere, creating a threat to many species of ice-associated marine mammals (Tynan and DeMaster 1997, Learmonth et al. 2006, Kovacs and Lydersen 2008, Laidre et al. 2008, Laidre et al. 2015). Pinnipeds such as the Harp Seal that are dependent on sea ice for pupping, moulting and resting are likely to be heavily impacted by future changes in their sea ice habitats (Johnston et al. 2005, Friedlaender et al. 2007, Kovacs et al. 2011, Kovacs et al. 2012). The high variability in pup production numbers in Canada, as well as the condition declines in the Northeast Atlantic, are thought to be linked to changing oceanographic and sea ice conditions. The degree of plasticity Harp Seals might show with respect to temporal or spatial shifts in breeding times and areas is not known.","The Harp Seal is the most abundant pinniped species in the northern hemisphere. Globally this species numbers close to nine million animals with an annual pup production for all breeding sites combined of approximately 1.2 million (ICES 2013, Hammill et al. 2014). The Northwest Atlantic stock is estimated to number close to 7.5 million (Hammill et al. 2014). This stock is thought to be relatively stable, showing little change between the 2004 and 2012 surveys, although pup production has become highly variable with extremely high pup mortality in some recent years. This is a marked recovery from an estimated low of around 1.8 million in the early 1970s, which was a result of overharvesting (Sergeant 1976). Over the period of recovery, catch levels have been increased such that they likely approached potential biological removal levels by the late 1990s (see Johnston et al. 2000). The current quota of 400,000 is likely not sustainable, but this is not a concern because the combined Greenlandic and Canadian harvest average only about half of this number. The breeding group in the West Ice near Jan Mayen (often referred to as the Greenland Sea population) was estimated to be 296,000 in 1994; this population increased to approximately 348,000 by 2003 and in 2013 was estimated to be 627,000 (ICES 2013, Øigård et al. 2014). The quota is approximately 20,000 animals, but an average take in the hunt in recent years is about 6,000 (ICES 2013). The White Sea breeding group was estimated to be 1.8 million animals when surveyed in 2000 (Potelov et al. 2003). An estimate produced in 2013 using data from several pup counts done between 1998 and 2010 suggested that the population had dropped to 1.4 million, most likely due to reduced pup production (ICES 2013). Hunting in recent years in the White Sea has been extremely limited (annual takes of zero to 200 animals); harvesting of pups less than one year of age was banned in Russia in 2009. Norwegian harvests of this population during summer when they are in the Barents Sea have also been very small in recent years, with no hunt at all in 2013 (ICES 2013).A new Harp Seal whelping patch was found near South Greenland in 2007 (Rosing-Asvid 2008). The source of these animals and the inter-annual stability of this group are not known. This finding was particularly interesting in light of the fact that the Greenlandic harvest of this species has increased from about 1,500 per year in the 1970s up to approximately 100,000 in the year 2000, and has remained at an average of around 85,000 since then (DFO 2012).",Increasing,"Harp Seals are widespread in the North Atlantic and the adjacent Arctic Ocean and shelf seas. Their range extends from a western extreme in northern Hudson Bay and the Foxe Basin, Baffin Island and the Davis Strait, eastward through the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and Newfoundland region in the western North Atlantic, along the southwest and south coasts of Greenland, continuing east to Iceland and from there to northern Norway and the White, Barents and Kara Seas. The northern limit in the eastern North Atlantic is at least to Franz Joseph Land and Svalbard; in some years Harp Seals may range northward to between 82° and 85° north, depending on ice conditions (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988, Rice 1998, Lavigne 2002). The southern limit of Harp Seal distribution off North America shifts southeast in some years to the Gulf of Maine and Sable Island where large numbers of animals have been recorded at times since the mid-1990s (Lacoste and Stenson 2000, Harris et al. 2002, Lucas and Daoust 2002). Harp Seals often occur as vagrants outside this range, south to Virginia in the United States (Scheffer 1958, Rice 1998). Similarly in Europe, Harp Seals occasionally reach the United Kingdom (Ronald and Healy 1981), the Faroe Islands, Denmark, Germany, France and even Spain (van Bree 1997, Bloch et al. 2000).Prehistorically, Harp Seals occurred in the Baltic Sea. Genetic drift, interspecific completion and overhunting by humans are all factors that are likely to have contributed to their extinction in that region (Stora and Ericson 2004).","Harp Seals have been harvested for thousands of years by indigenous peoples of the Atlantic Arctic, including coastal Northern Europeans (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). Basques whalers began taking Harp Seals in the 1500s. By the mid-1600s, French settlers developed land-based netting techniques on the St. Lawrence River. French-Canadians exported 500 tons of oil per year by the mid-1700s, obtained from an estimated take of 6,000 Harp Seals per year. In Newfoundland, English settlers hunted Harp Seals on a larger scale that accounted for an estimated average take of 7,000-12,800 Seals per year for most of the 1700s. By the 1800s, schooner-based sealing developed and the number of Seals harvested rose dramatically; from 1803-1816 the average annual take was 117,000. The peak of sealing in the Northwest Atlantic occurred between 1818 and 1862, when 500,000 Seals were harvested in many years, with maximum yearly takes between 640,000 and 740,000. During that time, it is estimated that 18.3 million Harp Seals, mostly whitecoats, were killed for oil. The records show somewhat lower figures for the Northeast Atlantic. At Jan Mayen, the catch began falling in the late 1850s; the drop in catch was likely attributable to over-harvesting. From 1860 to 1900, an estimated 12.8 million Seals were harvested from the West Ice.During the 20th century Harp Seals became more valued for their pelts than their oil. In 1917, 143,000 Seals were taken. The catch dropped for a time, then escalated in the 1950s, when it averaged 312,000 Seals per year. In 1960, Canada became concerned about the large numbers of adults being killed, so it placed limits on the length of the hunting season. During the 1960s, an average of 284,000 Seals were taken per year from the Northwest Atlantic stock. In the mid 1960s, adult females became protected on the breeding grounds, and Norway was excluded from sealing in Canadian waters. In 1971 a quota management program was established; from 1970 to 1987 quotas varied from 127,000 per year to 245,000 per year, but the actual harvest was often much lower than the quota (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). In 1983, the European Economic Community imposed an import ban on all whitecoat products and the average annual harvest in Canadian waters fell to 52,000 Seals from 1983-1995. By 1987, Canada banned the killing of whitecoats and the focus of the hunt switched to beaters (post-weaning to 13 months of age; DFO 2006a). From 1999-2003, the estimated annual mortality of Harp Seals in the Northwest Atlantic was 453,962, broken down into an average of 232,915 taken in the commercial harvest by Canada, 83,000 taken from 1999-2002 in Greenland, and approximately 5,000 taken in the Canadian High Arctic, plus a by-catch of close to 20,000 in the Newfoundland Lumpfish fishery, plus an average annual struck and loss rate of 119,430 from all harvests (Waring et al. 2005).The Canadian harvest increased with the combined three-year quota (“Total Allowable Catch”) introduced for the period 2003-2005 set at 975,000 (DFO 2005). Given the age structure of the current hunt, this quota would not be sustainable (see Johnston et al. 2000). The current quota is 400,000, but the number taken in the hunt is much less (see above). In addition to Canada’s commercial harvest, some Harp Seals are taken in subsistence hunts in Labrador, Newfoundland, northern Quebec and in Nunavut, as well as in Greenland. In Canada, aboriginal peoples and non-aboriginal coastal residents who reside north of latitude 53 degrees can hunt Seals for subsistence purposes without a permit (DFO 2006b).In the Northeast Atlantic, Norway established a commercial hunt in 1846, which peaked in the 1870s-1880s when annual catches ranged from 50,000 to 120,000 animals. In the 20th century, annual harvests increased to an average of more than 100,000 per year, with the maximum in the 1920s and 1930s when the catches were 200,000-300,000 per year. In 1989, Norway banned the killing of whitecoats (N-RFC 2005) and harvests in the last few decades have been small compared to historical numbers. Russia also banned the killing of white-coats in 2009 and the White Sea hunt has been almost negligible since that time.The numbers of Harp Seals struck-and-lost in the both the current commercial hunts (which focus largely on one plus animals) and in subsistence hunting is high, and most harvest estimates do not account for this additional mortality (see Lavigne 1999). The struck and loss rate for Harp Seals in Greenland could be as high as 50% (Sjare and Stenson 2002).",Marine,"Canada has in place sealing regulations pursuant to the 1993 Marine Mammal Regulations that require annual quotas, referred to as “Total Allowable Catches” hunting licenses, and official observers of the commercial Harp Seal hunt (DFO 2005). In the northeast Atlantic, quotas for sealing are based on recommendations made by the International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO). Russia is responsible for managing Harp Seals in the southeast part of the Barents Sea, while Norway is responsible for managing stocks in the Greenland Sea near Jan Mayen (N-RFC 2005, NMFCA 2006). However, these harvest control mechanisms are no longer particularly influential given the declining interest in Seal harvesting by commercial operators.",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45231341,41672,Pusa hispida,Least Concern,,2016,2016-01-16 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"As a species, Ringed Seals are widely distributed in ice-covered waters of the northern hemisphere, and they may presently number about three million animals. Some of the subspecies, however, have restricted distributions and exist in much smaller numbers. With climatic warming, all subspecies will be negatively impacted by continuing decreases of ice habitats critical for their reproduction. Nevertheless, at this time Ringed Seals as a species do not meet any IUCN criteria for a threatened listing, and are listed as Least Concern. Subspecies Pusa hispida ladogensis, the Ladoga Seal, is assessed separately as Vulnerable and subspecies P. h. saimensis, the Saimaa Seal, is assessed as Endangered.","Ringed Seals are in many respects the “classic” ice-seal. Throughout most of their range they use sea ice exclusively as their breeding, molting, and resting (haul-out) habitat, rarely if ever moving onto land (Frost and Lowry 1981, Reeves 1998). Their ability to create and maintain breathing holes in ice using the well-developed claws on their fore-flippers allows them to thrive in areas where even other ice-associated seals cannot reside. Although Ringed Seals are quite small they deal with the thermal challenges posed by the arctic winter by having a very thick blubber layer, and by building lairs (small caves) in the snow on top of sea ice during the winter. The lairs are particularly important for neonatal survival (Lydersen and Smith 1989). Ringed Seals also use natural cracks along pressure ridges and leads in the sea ice for surfacing and breathing. In Lakes Ladoga and Saimaa, the Baltic Sea, the White Sea, and the Sea of Okhotsk, Ringed Seals haul out and pup on ice but rest on shore during the ice-free period (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Kelly et al. 2010).Reported mean age at sexual maturity for female Ringed Seals varies in the literature from 3.5 to 7.1 years (Holst and Stirling 2002, Krafft et al. 2006). Males likely do not participate in breeding before they are 8-10 years old. Body sizes vary considerably between regions (Frost and Lowry 1981, Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998). Ringed seals are long lived, with ages close to 50 reported (Lydersen and Gjertz 1987). Regional productivity rates are variable; reproductive success depends on many factors including prey availability, the relative stability of the ice, and sufficient snow accumulation prior to the commencement of breeding (Lukin 1980, Smith 1987, Lydersen 1995). A single pup is born in late February-early March for the Ladoga, Saimaa, and Baltic subspecies (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998) and March-May for the others (Frost and Lowry 1981). Most births occur in subnivean lairs excavated in snow that accumulates near ice ridges or shorelines. Lairs provide thermal protection against cold air temperatures and high wind chill and afford at least some protection from predators (Smith 1976, Smith and Stirling 1975, Gjertz and Lydersen 1986). For Arctic Ringed Seals, lactation lasts an average of 39 days and pups are weaned at approximately 20 kg (Lydersen and Kovacs 1999). Females become receptive for mating towards the end of the lactation period, similar to other phocid seals. Ringed Seals molt from mid-May to mid-July and during that period they spend quite a bit of time hauled out (Reeves 1998). Feeding intensity is at a minimum during molting (Ryg et al. 1990). Although they may dive to more than 500 m (Born et al. 2004), in many areas where they feed the water is not that deep and dives are correspondingly shallower (Gjertz et al. 2000).Outside the breeding and molting seasons, Ringed Seal distribution is correlated with food availability (e.g., Simpkins et al. 2003, Freitas et al. 2008). Numerous studies of their diet have been conducted, and although there is considerable regional variation several patterns emerge. Most Ringed Seal prey are small, and preferred prey tend to be schooling species that form dense aggregations. Fishes are usually in the 5-10 cm length range and crustacean prey in the 2-6 cm range. Typically, a variety of 10-15 prey species are found, with no more than 2-4 dominant prey species for any given area. Fishes are generally more commonly eaten than invertebrates, but diet is determined to some extent by availability of various types of prey during particular seasons as well as by preference, which in part is influenced by energy content of various available prey (Reeves 1998, Wathne et al. 2000). Commonly eaten prey include Polar Cod, Arctic Cod, Saffron Cod, Redfish, Herring, and Capelin in marine waters (Lowry et al. 1980, Holst et al. 2001, Labansen et al. 2007), and Smelt, Vendance, Perch, Roach, Stickleback, and Burbot in lakes (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998). Invertebrate prey species seem to become more important in the open-water season and often dominate the diet of young animals (Lowry et al. 1980, Holst et al. 2001). Large Amphipods, Krill, Mysids, Shrimps, and Cephalopods are all eaten by Ringed Seals and can be very important in some regions at least seasonally (Agafonova et al. 2007).Polar Bears are the most important predator of Arctic Ringed Seals in most parts of their range and they are also eaten by Killer Whales and Walruses. Wolves, Wolverines, Foxes, Gulls, and Ravens may also prey on Ringed Seals, especially pups, in other areas (Reeves 1998).","Ringed Seals carry loads of organochlorine and heavy metal contaminants from industry and agriculture that have been implicated in uterine pathology in Baltic Seals (Bergman and Olsson 1986), and high concentrations of mercury in Saimaa Seals is thought to have reduced pup production in the 1960s and 1970s (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Kostamo et al. 2002). However, following restrictions on the use and release of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) into the environment, contaminant levels are dropping rapidly in the Baltic (Kostamo et al. 2002). The same is true with regards to POPs in Arctic populations (Wolkers et al. 2008). Oil contamination poses poorly known risks to Ringed Seals. The greatest impacts would likely result if spills occurred during the pupping season or if food resources were negatively affected (Smith 1987, Reeves 1998).Manipulation of water levels, recreational snow machine operation, net-fishing, boating, tourism, and development of cottages on the shoreline have been noted as threats to the Ringed Seals in Lake Saimaa, and industrial pollution, net fishing and poaching, as well as disturbance of on-shore summer haulout groups have been highlighted as threats for the Ladoga Seals (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Agafonova et al. 2007). Predation by Red Fox, Wolves, feral and domestic Dogs, and even birds of prey, are also risks for these lake Seals (e.g., Kunnasranta et al. 2001). By-catch in fisheries and other negative impacts associated with fisheries conflicts seem at present to be the major threat to Saimaa and Ladoga Seals (Kokko et al. 1998, Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Verevkin 2002, Sipilä 2003, Agafonova et al. 2007).Global warming may pose the greatest threat to Ringed Seals of all subspecies if it leads to large losses of the stable ice habitat required for pupping and rearing their young (Tynan and DeMaster 1997, Learmonth et al. 2006, Kovacs and Lydersen 2008, Laidre et al. 2008). Early break-up of the ice results in poor condition of pups and higher mortality rates (Smith and Harwood 2001). Associated changes in precipitation and weather patterns could also negatively affect Ringed Seal populations if there is insufficient snow cover to protect pups in lairs in the spring (Stirling and Derocher 1993, Ferguson et al. 2005, Kelly et al. 2010, Hezel et al. 2012, Iacozza and Ferguson 2014). Pups born outside lairs have a very low chance of survival; the pups are so small that even large Gulls can be predators if they are exposed (Lydersen and Smith 1989). Declining trends in reproduction and survival of pups have already been noted in some regions that have been attributed to earlier break-up of the sea ice over recent decades and concomitant changes in the marine ecosystem (Ferguson et al. 2005, Stirling 2005). Reductions in arctic sea ice could have quite dramatic effects via prey availability if Polar and Arctic Cod populations are negatively impacted. Reductions in sea ice cover will likely lead to increased human activity in arctic regions in the form of shipping and resource extraction industries, with associated increased threat of marine accidents and pollution discharge (Pagnan 2000). An increase in human-created noise in the arctic environment could cause marine mammals, including Ringed Seals, to abandon areas (Tynan and DeMaster 1997) although studies to date suggest relatively minor impacts of development (Davis et al. 1991; Moulton et al. 2002, 2003, 2005; Blackwell et al. 2004). However, over-flights by aircraft certainly cause disturbance to Ringed Seals if flights occur by helicopter at less than 1,500 m distance or by fixed-winged aircraft at closer than 500 m (Born et al. 1999).","Available data on Ringed Seal abundance were compiled and reviewed in the 2016 IUCN Red List assessments for the five recognized subspecies. Estimates of the number of mature individuals, and population trend, for each of those subspecies were as follows: Arctic Ringed Seal--1,450,000, trend unknown Okhotsk Ringed Seal--44,000, trend unknown Baltic Ringed Seal--11,500, trend increasing Ladoga Seal--3,000-4,500, trend increasing Saimaa Seal--135-190, trend increasingThe world-wide population size of Ringed Seals is not accurately known. Some recent survey data are available from parts of their range (see subspecies assessments), but for the Arctic and Okhotsk subspecies data are limited in spatial scope. Citing many factors such as the vast geographic area occupied by the species, its highly variable distribution within areas that have been surveyed, the unknown relationship between the numbers of individuals observed versus those not seen, and other factors, Frost and Lowry (1981) stated that it is “unwise to attempt an estimate of the world population of this subspecies”. Despite numerous surveys at specific locales conducted since then, Reeves (1998) believed that “this conclusion remains appropriate.”Nevertheless, the figures presented above indicate the number of mature individuals is more than 1.5 million, and the total population size is likely more than 3 million.",Unknown,"Ringed Seals have a circumpolar distribution throughout the Arctic Basin including records of individuals near the North Pole (Rice 1998). Ringed Seals also range widely into adjacent seas being found in the Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Davis Strait, and Greenland, Barents, White, Kara, Laptev, and East Siberian Seas, and they occasionally range into some lake and river systems in Northern Canada (Heide-Jørgensen and Lydersen 1998). Separate subspecies occur in the Baltic Sea, Lake Ladoga in the Russian Federation, Lake Saimaa in Finland, and the Sea of Okhotsk (Frost and Lowry 1981, Reeves 1998). Extralimital records for Ringed Seals extend far south on both sides of the Atlantic, to New Jersey USA in the west and Portugal in the east. In the Pacific, vagrants have been recorded south to the Zhejiang in China and southern California USA (Rice 1998).","Humans have hunted Ringed Seals in the Arctic since the arrival of people to the region millennia ago (e.g., Murdoch 1893, Riewe and Amsden 1979). They are a fundamental subsistence food item for most coastal dwelling northern indigenous peoples. Reeves et al. (1998) reported a combined estimate of 10,000 taken per year from the Bering, Chukchi, and western Beaufort Seas by Russians and Alaska Natives. They also estimated that the annual removal of Ringed Seals in the Canadian Arctic was in the “high tens of thousands”, and that in the 1980s, including animals killed and lost, the harvest was between 60,000 and 80,000, and may have exceeded 100,000 in some years. Another substantial annual harvest occurs in Greenland with nearly 100,000 taken per year in the 1970s and approximately 70,000 taken annually in the early1990s (Teilmann and Kapel 1998).Commercial harvests of Ringed Seals in the early to mid-20th century were sometimes large and probably had significant local impacts on the respective populations. Harvest statistics reported for western Russia by Belikov and Boltunov (1998) suggest that maximum catches earlier in the 20th century exceeded the total allowable catches (TACs) significantly, with harvests of up to 8,900 in the White Sea (1912), 13,200 in the Russian Barents Sea (1962), and 13,200 in the Kara Sea (1933). Those harvests are thought to have dropped considerably in recent decades, though there are no available data. Reporting of harvest statistics and enforcement of TACs is difficult to manage in outlying areas, and the harvest of Ringed Seals in eastern Russia is largely unknown.Although Ringed Seals in the Baltic and Lakes Ladoga and Saimaa were hunted in the past, hunting is no longer allowed (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Härkönen et al. 1998).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Ringed Seals are protected by a variety of laws and quotas in different parts of their range, but even within Europe the legal provisions are not always being fully implemented in domestic law (Wilson et al. 2001). The population in Lake Saimaa has been protected since 1955, and additional protection has been afforded via the establishment of two national parks within the lake, and regulation of shoreline development. Similarly, the hunting of Seals in Lake Ladoga was prohibited in 1980 (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998). In the USA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 allows Ringed Seals to be harvested only by Alaskan Native hunters for subsistence purposes, and that Act generally prohibits all other forms of taking except where specifically permitted. In 2012, the Arctic, Okhotsk, and Baltic subspecies were listed as threatened, and the Ladoga subspecies was listed as endangered, under the US Endangered Species Act; the Saimaa subspecies was listed as endangered in 1993. State Nature Reserves at Franz Josef Land and in the White and Kara seas protect large areas of Ringed Seal habitat in the western Russian Arctic, and quotas and licensing of hunting have been in place in various parts of the Russian Federation for decades (Belikov and Boltunov 1998). Baltic Ringed Seals were protected from all killing by the Soviet Union in 1980, by Sweden in 1986, and by Finland in 1988 (Härkönen et al. 1998).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45231738,41676,Pusa sibirica,Least Concern,,2016,2015-07-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The current population size of the Baikal Seal is thought to be at the level of the Lake Baikal ecosystem’s carrying capacity (80,000–100,000 individuals). If global warming continues the quality of habitat of the species will decline dramatically which may cause the population to decline. However, Baikal Seals have survived periods of quite extreme warming in the past and the population undergoes periodic monitoring such that declines would be detected rapidly should they occur. Thus, at the current time the Baikal Seal is listed as Least Concern.","Baikal Seals are an exclusively freshwater species, and are thought to derive from the marine ancestor of the Pusa genus. It is hypothesized they colonized Lake Baikal from the Arctic via rivers and glacial dam lakes present in northern Siberia 300,000-400,000 years ago (McLaren 1960, Pastukhov 1969a, Koyama et al. 1997, Sasaki et al. 2003, Palo and Väinöla 2006). However, this is at odds with the current DNA sequence based estimate of around 2 million years for the divergence of the Pusa genus. This suggest a complex history of vicariance with the group, but the underlying paleogeography remains to be determined (Palo and Väinöla 2006, Fulton and Strobeck 2010, Nyakatura and Bininda-Emonds 2012).Baikal Seals are among the smallest of the pinnipeds, with adults reaching 1.1-1.4 m and weights of 50-130 kg. Pups are born at 3-3.5 kg and approximately 70 cm (Pastukhov 1971, Thomas et al. 1982). Adult males at physical maturity are slightly larger than adult females of the same age. Final body size is reached at approximately 15 years of age (Amano et al. 2000). Males reach sexual maturity at 7-10 years of age (Pastukhov 1993). Female Baikal Seals become sexually mature between 3-7 years and some have their first pup by age 4, most by 5-6 years, with some not pupping until they are 9 years old (Pastukhov 1969b, Thomas et al. 1982). Baikal Seals continue to produce pups until they are 43-45 years old and may have the greatest longevity of any pinniped species. Approximately 10% of the population is older than 20 years of age, with records of adult females reaching 56 years of age and adult males 52 years of age (Pastukhov 1990, 1993).The annual cycle of the Baikal Seal is driven by ice more than food (Ivanov 1938). In mid-October, the Seals begin to move towards bays, lagoons and river deltas, mostly along the eastern shore where ice forms and expands out into the lake. They spend January to May spread throughout the lake, usually singly, in deep water in the central basins. Adults stay primarily in the north while immature Seals are more often found in the southern part of Lake Baikal. Pups are born from late February to early April, with peak numbers born in mid March (Pastukhov 1990). Pupping takes place on the ice in dens that females actively build and maintain. During the pupping season, females are widely spread out on the ice. Their surface home ranges, including the den and breathing holes, are a minimum of 0.26 km² and do not overlap with other females (Ivanov 1938, Elagin et al. 1990, Pastukhov 1993, Martinkova et al. 2001). Pups do not usually enter the water for their first 2-3 weeks.Most pups are weaned in 2-2.5 months, although some are believed to be nursed for 3-3.5 months (Pastukhov 1971). Females move pups and construct new dens if the dens become damaged; this may be necessary to protect small pups from predators. Mating is believed to take place in April, approximately one month after the female gives birth (Pastukhov 1993). Although births take place throughout the lake, more pups (51%) are born in the northern third of the lake, as compared to the central third (31%) or the southern third (17%) (Pastukhov 1971, Thomas et al. 1982, Petrov et al. 1997).The ice breaks up in May and June, a time when Baikal Seals undergo their annual moult. More than half of the population moves to the remaining ice in the northern and northeastern parts of Lake Baikal, forming aggregations that can be as large as 1,000-3,000 animals. Moulting takes place during an approximately month-long period, during which Baikal Seals feed very little (Pastukhov 1993). Many Baikal Seals congregate in the southeastern part of the lake in the ice-free season to haul-out on rocky islands and shorelines between feeding excursions (Ivanov 1938, Pastukhov 1993, Petrov et al. 1997). The eastern side of the lake is preferred because it has less human disturbance and greater biological productivity (Pastukhov 1993). It is not known whether Baikal Seals have a regular annual movement pattern. Satellite-tagging of four juvenile Seals revealed that they moved throughout the lake in the course of a year, traveling from 400 to 1,600 km between September through May. Although it may not be typical of adult Seals, the pattern of frequent diving and movement demonstrates that juveniles move considerable distances and spend little time hauled-out during the fall and winter months. Two of the four Seals tagged in autumn returned to their tagging sites the following spring after wandering widely throughout the lake (Stewart et al. 1996). Diving patterns are not well documented; tagged juvenile Baikal Seals dived most frequently to between 10 and 50 m, with some dives exceeding 300 m. The mean depth in Lake Baikal is 758 m (Kutyrev et al. 2006). Dive depths were shallower at night, consistent with the vertical movements of their preferred prey fish, the two species of Golomyankas (Comeophorus spp.) that ascend from depths of 100 m or more during the day to forage at 10-25 m at night. Dive durations were generally 2-4 minutes, with 14-30% of dives lasting 6-10 minutes. The longest recorded dives exceeded 40 minutes and occurred during the winter in areas of heavy ice cover (Stewart et al. 1996). Baikal Seals feed on fish and 29 species have been recorded in their diet. Along with the two species of Golomyankas mentioned above, they also consume two species of Sculpin (Cottocomephorus spp.) as primary prey. Diversity of fish species consumed is highest in the summer with 17 species eaten, declining to 8 species in fall, and only 4 principal species eaten in winter. Juveniles may also consume amphipods during winter (Ivanov 1938, Pastukhov 1967, Gurova and Pastukhov 1974, Thomas et al. 1982).","Major rivers flowing into Lake Baikal pass through regions of industrial activity and there are concerns over contamination from persistent organic pollutants such as polycholorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltricholoethanes (DDTs), dioxins, flame retardants and other related chemicals (Mamontov et al. 2000). Exposure to such bioaccumulative chemicals has potential to impair fertility and immunocompetence (De Swart et al. 1995, Kannan et al. 2000). Numerous studies have assessed contaminant levels in Baikal Seals from the 1990s to present (e.g., Kucklick et al. 1994; Nakata et al. 1995, 1997; Tarasova et al. 1997; Tanabe et al. 2003; Tsydenova et al. 2003, 2004; Iwata et al. 2004; Ishibashi et al. 2008; Imaeda et al. 2009). These show complex and varying temporal trends, with levels of DDTs and non-ortho PCBs declining through the 1990s to mid-2000s, while others such as mono-ortho PCBs showed no decline and perflourochemicals increased (Tanabe et al. 2003, Tsydenova et al. 2004, Ishibashi et al. 2008, Imaeda et al. 2009). This variation reflects differences in environmental half-life and rates of inflow of chemicals stemming from changes in industrial usage patterns.Overall contaminant burdens at the population level for Baikal Seals are lower than pinniped species from areas of Europe and North America with high industrial contamination, but greater than Seals from ‘cleaner’ Arctic environments, although some individual animals have been found to have high burdens. The most recent study (Imaeda et al. 2009) found that 40% of Seals in the tested sample from 2005 had TEQ (Toxic Equivalent – a measure for summarising relative toxicity of complex contaminant mixtures) levels above a threshold associated with immune suppressive effects identified in Harbour Seals (De Swart et al. 1995). Organochlorine accumulation is age related, so older adult males are the most likely component of the population to be above these thresholds (Iwata et al. 2004). However, demonstrating effects of contaminants in the wild is difficult, and there is currently no direct evidence of contaminant burdens affecting disease susceptibility or influencing population demography in Baikal Seals. Recent studies on liver gene expression profiles in Baikal Seals suggest changes to liver metabolism consistent with toxicity in relation to environmental contaminant exposure, but the overall health significance is not clear (Hirakawa et al. 2011). Industrial development is increasing around the Baikal watershed so it is important that monitoring of contaminant exposure in Baikal Seals is continued in the future (Reijnders et al. 1993, Nakata et al. 1997, Mamontov et al. 2000, Grachev 2002, Imaeda et al. 2009).An outbreak of a canine distemper virus killed approximately 6,500 Baikal Seals in 1987-1988 (Grachev et al. 1989, Pronin and Kabanov 1992, Belykov et al. 1997), and is believed to have been transmitted to Seals from a terrestrial source, probably feral or domestic Dogs (Barrett et al. 1992). Recent surveys show that the virus is still circulating in the population, although without causing further mass mortalities to date (Mamaev et al. 1996, Butina et al. 2003, 2010). However, future epizootics remain possible, and it is recommended that surveillance of CDV strains circulating in the population be continued (Butina et al. 2010). Natural predation does not appear to be a significant source of mortality for Baikal Seals, with only Brown Bears (Ursus arctos) reported as predators (Pastukhov 1993).As a landlocked ice-breeding species, Baikal Seals may be vulnerable to future climate change since they cannot move to alternative habitats (Kovacs et al. 2012). Future climate warming has the potential to reduce the extent and duration of ice-habitat Baikal Seals rely on for breeding, and to also affect Baikal food webs (Mackay et al. 2006, Hampton et al. 2008, Moore et al. 2009), both of which could drive population declines. The potential effects of changes in winter ice on Baikal Seal population demography remain to be assessed in detail, but the species has persisted through previous episodes of climate variation.","Following hunting in the early 20th Century, the Baikal Seal population increased from the 1970s through the early 1990s to over 100,000 individuals (Petrov et al. 1997; Petrov 2002, 2003). Population abundance subsequently declined slightly, probably due to commercial harvesting and outbreaks of canine distemper virus. Reports of current abundance vary between the different studies carried out since 2002, with estimates ranging between 82,500 and 115,000 individuals including pups (Petrov 2002, 2003, 2006; Ministry of Natural Resources 2013). The most recently reported figures derive from surveys carried out by the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources (2013), and report an increase from 97,400 individuals in 2012 to 108,200 in 2013, with an estimated pup production of 23,600, although the methodological details of this survey are not available. The population estimates may be subject to survey errors of about 30% (Petrov et al. 1997), and incomplete or inadequate coverage of the breeding range throughout the lake makes it difficult to draw robust conclusions about population demography. Therefore, short term abundance trends based on count data may merely reflect survey error variations. Currently Baikal Seals are considered to be at the carrying capacity level of the Baikal Lake ecosystem.",Stable,"Lake Baikal is located in southern Siberia, Russia, near the Mongolian border. The lake is 636 km long and at its maximum 79.5 km wide (Kutyrev et al. 2006). Baikal Seals are basically confined to Lake Baikal (31,570 km²), though they do travel short distances into rivers that flow into and out of the lake. An exception is one animal that was found 400 km downstream in the Angara River, the only river that flows out of the lake (Ivanov 1938, Pastukhov 1993, Rice 1998).","Subsistence hunting of the Baikal Seal extends back at least 9,000 years to the Neolithic period (Khlobystin 1963, Weber et al. 1993, Nomokonova et al. 2015). Commercial hunting began in the second half of the 18th century (Ivanov 1938, Pastukhov 1993), becoming a regular industry in the early in the 20th century. Annual harvests fluctuated between 2,000 and 9,000 Seals in the early 20th century, then from under 1,000 to nearly 6,500 in the 1930s (Svatosh 1923, 1925; Ivanov 1938). Harvests from 1977 to 1983 were consistently high. The official harvest quota and catch level was about 6,000, plus an estimated “unofficial hunting” level of up to 3,600 Seals (Pastukhov 1993). In the late 1980s and early 1990s the official statistics were not reliable and did not reflect the actual harvest level. Estimates vary between 4,000 and 8,000 animals (Petrov et al. 1997) killed annually. Harvesting continues today. During 2004-2006 about 2,000 Seals were reported killed in annual official statistics with estimations of an additional “uncounted” harvest of between 1,500 and 4,000 animals annually (Petrov 2007). The “uncounted” harvest includes wounded or drowned animals, incidental catch in fishing gear, and poaching. More recently, total hunting including poaching was estimated at between 2,300-2,800 annually for 2012 and 2013 (Ministry of Natural Resources 2013). A quota of 2,500 was set for the official hunt in 2013-2014, with a Potential Biological Removal level of 5,000 individuals. There are some calls to expand hunting, with skins, meat, and blubber as the products being utilized.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Numerous measures, such as establishing commercial harvest quotas, changing methods and equipment used for harvesting Seals, and changing the timing of the hunt and the age class of Seal that can be taken, have all been used during the history of the commercial harvest to regulate the catch (Svatosh 1923, 1925; Ivanov 1938; Pastukhov 1993; Petrov et al. 1997). Recent recommendations for the protection and conservation of the Baikal Seal include several measures to reduce the impact of poaching by local residents (including increased penalties for illegal hunting) and mandatory reporting of incidental catch in fishing gear (Pastukhov 1993). There are many protected areas and reserves throughout Lake Baikal.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global
238637039,13653,Monachus monachus,Vulnerable,D1,2023,2023-06-27 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Mediterranean Monk Seal (Monachus monachus) is one of the most endangered pinniped species and an Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) mammal (Isaac et al. 2007).Historically, commercial seal hunting and human persecution (Johnson and Lavigne 1998, Johnson 2004, González 2015) wiped out colonies living on open beaches and reduced Mediterranean Monk Seal populations to small numbers. This in turn led to a change in terrestrial habitat use and produced severe bottleneck(s) that significantly reduced genetic diversity. For most of the 20th century, numbers continued to decline, mostly as a consequence of human invasion into critical seal habitat, persecution and adverse fishing interactions. This resulted ultimately in the fragmentation of the species into several subpopulations and its disappearance from most of its historical range. At the species level, the Mediterranean Monk Seal was listed on the IUCN Red List as “Critically Endangered” at the Global scale in 2008 (Aguilar and Lowry 2008); a re-assessment in 2015 listed the species as “Endangered” (EN) (Karamanlidis and Dendrinos 2015). In 2019, the subpopulation in the eastern Mediterranean Sea was also listed as Endangered (Karamanlidis et al. 2019).Mediterranean Monk Seals continue to be exposed to a number of substantial threats, including habitat loss and deterioration [e.g., in the Cabo Blanco Peninsula (Ras Nouadhibou) and the Archipelago of Madeira pup mortality has been attributed mainly to pupping in unsuitable habitat (Pires et al. 2020, Fernández de Larrinoa et al. 2021)], displacement, as well as persecution and negative interactions with fisheries (Karamanlidis et al. 2016a, Karamanlidis et al. 2020) and tourism (Pires et al. 2020). Currently, however, the primary constraint for population growth of the small Monk Seal subpopulation in the Archipelago of Madeira are the low reproductive rates that are likely a result of the low marine productivity around Madeira (Pires et al. 2023). Unpredictable threats, such as disease, toxic algal blooms (red tides) (Martínez-Jauregui et al. 2012), cave collapses (González et al. 1997), pollution (e.g., oil spills, microplastic) and habitat change due to climate change also pose (potential) threats to the Mediterranean Monk Seal.There is recent evidence of a significant increase in the range of the Monk Seal in Greece, which is one of the main reproductive areas of the European Mediterranean Monk Seal subpopulation (Adamantopoulou et al. 2022). In Türkiye a range expansion and an increase in sightings have also been documented (SAD-AFAG unpublished data September 2023), while in the Archipelago of Madeira, the population has been growing from 2012 to 2021 slowly, but steadily, with a rate of 3% (Pires et al. 2023). In the Cabo Blanco Peninsula, the local Monk Seal subpopulation has grown to its pre-mass die-off levels (Fernández de Larrinoa et al. 2021). The number of mature individuals is now thought to be globally more than 250, but less than 1,000 individuals. Because the global population of the Monk Seal still remains small, it qualifies as Vulnerable (VU) under Red List Criterion D1.Conservation priorities for the Mediterranean Monk Seal include: a) strengthening the legal framework for the protection of the terrestrial and marine habitat of the species, b) effective protection of the species (i.e., reduction of deliberate killing) and its terrestrial and marine habitat, c) population and habitat monitoring (including, for example, determining food availability and primary death causes), d) rescue and rehabilitation of injured, orphaned and sick individuals, e) public awareness, f) monitoring and mitigating negative seal – fishery interactions (Karamanlidis et al. 2016a), and g) expansion of the species’ current geographic range in the Atlantic Ocean (González et al. 2006).","Mediterranean Monk Seals are medium-sized phocids that reach 2.3-2.8 m in length (Littnan et al. 2018). Based on seals examined after a mass mortality event in the Cabo Blanco Peninsula (Ras Nouadhibou), average adult lengths were estimated at 2.42 m in females and 2.51 m in males. Pups up to three months of age averaged 1.08 m in length with a range of 0.74-1.38 m (Samaranch and González 2000). In Europe, new-born pups average 1.02 m and 15.5 kg in weight (Dendrinos 2011). Adults weigh from 240-300 kg (Littnan et al. 2018), with maximum records for a male weighing 400 kg and a pregnant female 302 kg (Sergeant et al. 1978).Mediterranean Monk Seal pups in the Cabo Blanco Peninsula (Ras Nouadhibou) moult on average 64 days after birth in the case of females and 82 days on average in the case of males; the moult occurs partly in the water and is completed after approximately 15 days (Badosa et al. 2006). In contrast, in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, the first moult occurs 19-57 days postpartum (Dendrinos 2011). Adult male Monk Seals develop the characteristic, black, adult pelage at the age of 4-6 years (Koemtzopoulos et al. 2022; R. Pires pers. comm. September 2023).Mediterranean Monk Seals once hauled out on open beaches (Johnson and Lavigne 1999, Johnson 2004), but today they primarily use throughout their range marine caves for hauling out, resting, and pupping (González 2015, Karamanlidis et al. 2016a). However, in recent years Monk Seals in the Archipelago of Madeira (since 1997) (Pires et al. 2020) and in Greece (Dendrinos et al. 2008, Dendrinos et al. 2022) have been observed hauling out increasingly on open beaches and resting in the water (Pires 2011, Karamanlidis et al. 2017).Most marine caves used by Mediterranean Monk Seals for resting and pupping possess a set of common geophysical characteristics, that include an entrance corridor and a dry surface/area where the seals haul out (Karamanlidis et al. 2004, Dendrinos et al. 2007b). Seal preferences regarding cave selection and use in an area are influenced by numerous parameters (Dendrinos et al. 1994). As a result, Monk Seals in the eastern Mediterranean and the Archipelago of Madeira use a high number of marine caves for resting and pupping (Gücü et al. 2004; MOm 2007, 2008b, 2009). In Greece, more than 500 caves have been found to be occupied by the species and more than 100 are used for pupping (MOm 2007, 2008b, 2009). Similarly, in a study that covered the coastline inhabited by Monk Seals in the Cilician Basin region of southern Türkiye 39 marine caves were discovered, including three that were used for pupping and 16 that were actively used at the time of the survey (Gücü et al. 2004). At the island of Madeira and the sub-archipelago of the Desertas Islands 12 and 13 marine caves are considered to be suitable for the Mediterranean Monk Seal; from these, two and nine respectively are currently used by the species (Pires et al. 2020). In contrast, in the Cabo Blanco Peninsula (Ras Nouadhibou) only three caves are primarily used for hauling out and pupping (Fernández de Larrinoa et al. 2021). Cave selection may be influenced by changes in the internal morphology of a cave, as has been seen to occur in the Cabo Blanco Peninsula (Ras Nouadhibou) (González et al. 1997) or the state of the tide (only in the Atlantic populations, as tides in the Mediterranean are negligible) (Pires et al. 2007). Monk Seal activity in and around the marine caves in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and the Archipelago of Madeira is highest in autumn and winter and coincides with the pupping season of the species (Dendrinos et al. 1994, Gücü et al. 2004, Pires et al. 2007, Dendrinos 2011).Monk Seal pupping in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and the Archipelago of Madeira is quite synchronous, occurring mainly in the months of October and November. This has been the case for more than 220 pups born in Greece from 1990 to 2014 (Dendrinos et al. 1994, Dendrinos 2011, MOm unpublished data September 2023), for 11 pups born at the Cilician Basin (Gücü et al. 2004) and six pups born at the coasts of İzmir and Muğla in Türkiye (SAD-AFAG unpublished data September 2023) and the majority of pups born in Madeira from 1990 onwards (Pires 2011, IFCN unpublished data September 2023). In contrast, in the Cabo Blanco Peninsula (Ras Nouadhibou) births can take place throughout the year (P. Fernández de Larrinoa pers. comm. September 2023). Pups begin to catch fish toward the end of their lactation period (Pastor and Aguilar 2003) and are weaned when they are about four months old, with up to five months reported (Pastor and Aguilar 2003, Aguilar et al. 2007, Dendrinos 2011, Kıraç and Ok 2019). Fostering and allosuckling are not uncommon and have been recorded in the Cabo Blanco Peninsula (Ras Nouadhibou) (Aguilar et al. 2007), the Archipelago of Madeira (Pires 2004), and in Greece (Karamanlidis et al. 2013). At the Cabo Blanco subpopulation, in 26.6% of the suckling episodes observed in mother–pup pairs of known identity, pups suckled from females other than their mothers. Some females nursed more than one pup at least occasionally, and in some cases, a pup was fostered long-term by an unrelated female (Aguilar et al. 2007). Pups enter the water and begin diving during the first week of their life (Karamanlidis et al. 2010, Karamanlidis et al. 2021a).Generation length for the Mediterranean Monk Seal is estimated to be 11.2 years (Pacifici et al. 2013). Female Monk Seals in the Cabo Blanco Peninsula (Ras Nouadhibou) become sexually mature at three years of age (Fernández de Larrinoa et al. 2021) and can give birth in successive years. In contrast, in the Archipelago of Madeira, the age of first reproduction of females has been estimated at 6-7 years of age (Pires et al. 2020, Pires et al. 2023). Male Monk Seals have been recorded to become sexually mature at the age of four in Cabo Blanco, at the age of 4.5 in Greece (Koemtzopoulos et al. 2022) and at the age of 4-6 years in the Archipelago of Madeira (R. Pires pers. comm. September 2023).Annual pup survival in the Cabo Blanco Peninsula (Ras Nouadhibou) is 0.59 (0.55-0.62) at two months of age and 0.46 (0.43-0.49) from birth to the age of one year (Fernández de Larrinoa et al. 2021). In the Archipelago of Madeira, the survival rate during the first year of life is 0.47 (0.31-0.64) (Pires et al. 2023). In the eastern Mediterranean Sea, and more specifically in Greece, annual pup survival until weaning has not been estimated, but is suspected to be generally higher (i.e., 0.7) than that recorded in the Atlantic subpopulations, which is most likely due to the fact that lactating females and their pups have a higher number of suitable caves to choose from when seeking refuge from severe weather conditions.Telemetry studies have been performed in the Cabo Blanco Peninsula (Ras Nouadhibou) and in the Archipelago of Madeira in order to assess the diving behaviour of the Monk Seal. In the Cabo Blanco Peninsula, the maximum depth and duration of diving for one lactating female were 78 m and 15 minutes respectively (Gazo and Aguilar 2005), and 100 m for an adult male (P. Fernandez de Larrinoa pers. comm. September 2023). Although maximum dive depths for an adult male and an adult female of 393 m and 429 m have been recorded in the Archipelago of Madeira respectively, the majority (i.e., 80%) of the dives were between 0 m and 49 m and 99.6% of the dives occurred up to a depth of 200 m (Pires et al. 2020). In the eastern Mediterranean Sea, maximum dive depths for a rehabilitated male and a female Monk Seal in Greece were 123 m (Dendrinos et al. 2007a) and 191 m (MOm unpublished data September 2023), respectively. In Türkiye, adult Monk Seals have been observed to dive for an average of approximately 6.5 minutes and then rest at the surface for approximately one minute (Kıraç et al. 2002). Monk seals in the eastern Mediterranean Sea have been recorded to travel ~288 km in three months with a maximum straight distance travelled of ~78 km (Adamantopoulou et al. 2011).Stomach content analysis of dead Monk Seals has revealed that they have a heterogeneous diet consisting of bony fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans. In Greece for example, Monk Seals are known to eat more than 70 different prey species [50% cephalopods, 48% fishes, 1.5% non-cephalopod molluscs, 0.4% crustaceans (Pierce et al. 2011)]. The Common Octopus (Octopus vulgaris ~34%) and bony fish from the family Sparidae (~28%) were most frequently identified in Monk Seal stomachs (Pierce et al. 2011). Collectively, results from throughout the range of the species from direct observations (Neves 1998, Neves and Pires 1999), stomach content (Machado 1979, Salman et al. 2001, Karamanlidis et al. 2011, Pierce et al. 2011, Tonay et al. 2016, Pires et al. 2020) and stable isotope analyses (Karamanlidis et al. 2014) suggest that Monk Seals in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and in the Archipelago of Madeira forage primarily on the continental shelf along the coast.","Mediterranean Monk Seals have a long history of interaction with humans that includes exploitation for subsistence needs, commercial harvest, and persecution as a competitor for fisheries resources or because they caused actual and perceived damage to fishing gear (Johnson and Lavigne 1999, Stringer et al. 2008, González 2015). Once abundant, Monk Seals were written about and illustrated in the literature of classical antiquity (Johnson 2004).The major reasons for the population decline of Monk Seals in the 20th century include: increased human pressure displacing seals from their original habitat; destruction/alteration of suitable habitat; negative interactions with the fisheries industry (including aquaculture), i.e., deliberate aggression by fishermen to eliminate a competitor, even in countries and areas where the species is legally protected; fisheries bycatch and a mass mortality (Forcada et al. 1999, Kıraç et al. 2013, Karamanlidis et al. 2016a, Karamanlidis et al. 2020, Kıraç et al. 2020, Pires et al. 2020).Habitat deterioration, destruction, and fragmentation have played a significant role in the plight of the Mediterranean Monk Seal. Once an open beach dweller, the species has been persecuted by humans for centuries and forced into increasingly marginal habitat. This habitat shift has been thoroughly documented (Johnson and Lavigne 1999). This marginalization is still the case today, both, in the eastern Mediterranean Sea (MOm 2007, Kıraç et al. 2013, Dendrinos et al. 2020) and in the Atlantic Ocean, where the high pup mortality recorded currently has been associated with pupping in suboptimal habitat (Pires et al. 2020). An alarming decline in pupping success has been recorded in the most important pupping location of the species in southern Türkiye, due to increased human activity (i.e., industrial development, including the construction of a thermal and nuclear power plant and a marine terminal). Critical Monk Seal habitat has been affected by increased tourism activities throughout Türkiye, even in protected areas such as the Olympos Beydagları National Park, and the Kas, Kekova Specially Protected Area. Although some resting activity by Mediterranean Monk Seals continues in these caves, no pupping has been recorded recently (Gücü et al. 2009b). Tourists and SCUBA divers, boat excursions, and even unauthorized and incompetent research activities in Monk Seal shelters in Türkiye appear to have increased in the last decade and are considered a disturbance to the species (Kıraç and Savaş 2019, SAD-AFAG unpublished data September 2023). Similarly, in the Archipelago of Madeira tourism activities at sea are considered to be a disturbance to Mediterranean Monk Seals if not conducted properly (Pires et al. 2020). With human populations and coastal activities increasing throughout the range of the species there are corresponding increases in threats to the species' habitat.Interactions with fisheries remain a great conservation concern throughout the entire range of the Monk Seal (Güçlüsoy and Savaş 2003; Güçlüsoy 2008a,b; Karamanlidis et al. 2008, Karamanlidis et al. 2020). The deliberate killing of Monk Seals, mainly by fishermen, has been responsible for at least 110 dead seals recorded throughout Greece from 1990 on (MOm unpublished data September 2023) and is considered one of the most important sources of mortality for the species in the eastern Mediterranean (Androukaki et al. 1999). Deliberate killing, hunting, and the capture of live animals for exhibition purposes were the main cause for the population reduction of the species in Türkiye until 1980 (Kıraç et al. 2013). At least 14 Monk Seals have died from entanglement in fishing gear in the Turkish Aegean and Mediterranean Sea (Kıraç et al. 2020, SAD-AFAG unpublished data September 2023). In the Archipelago of Madeira the aquaculture industry increasingly represents a threat to the local Monk Seal population (Pires et al. 2020).Mediterranean Monk Seals have been entangled in a wide variety of fishing gear including set-nets, trawl nets, and long-lines (Johnson and Karamanlidis 2000) and entanglement remains a major source of mortality in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, especially for sub-adult animals (Karamanlidis et al. 2008, Kıraç et al. 2013, Karamanlidis et al. 2020, Kıraç et al. 2020). In the Archipelago of Madeira, despite original indications that negative interactions with fisheries were lower than in other areas of the species’ distribution (Hale et al. 2011), recent data indicate that accidental catches in fishing traps and deliberate killings associated with this industry are on the rise (Pires et al. 2020).Potentially, limited availability of food sources, genetic inbreeding, pollution, cave collapses and epizootic outbreaks could constitute threats to the survival of the Monk Seal. In the Archipelago of Madeira for example, limited food resources have been associated with the poor nutritional status of individual Monk Seals and the late sexual maturity of females compared to other areas of the species’ distribution (Pires et al. 2020). Similarly, in the Cabo Blanco Peninsula, a mass mortality event such as the one that occurred in 1997 (Forcada et al. 1999) and/or the collapse of one or more of the remaining marine caves used by the species (González et al. 1997) would have detrimental effects on this subpopulation (Fernández de Larrinoa et al. 2021).Genetic analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA (Pastor et al. 2007, Karamanlidis et al. 2016b, Gaubert et al. 2019, Rey-Iglesia et al. 2020, Karamanlidis et al. 2021b) have shown that as a consequence of severe population bottlenecks and population/habitat fragmentation, Monk Seals have suffered a dramatic decrease in genetic diversity over the last few centuries. The genetic diversity of Mediterranean Monk Seals is among the lowest found in pinnipeds; it is comparable to Hawaiian Monk Seals (Neomonachus schauinslandi) and Northern Elephant Seals (Mirounga angustirostris) (Karamanlidis et al. 2016b). The potential consequences of the loss of genetic variability and genetic inbreeding are still hard to evaluate for the Mediterranean Monk Seal. Additionally, low fitness and increased susceptibility to disease may be an effect of genetic erosion.Contaminant burdens have always been suspected to be a threat to the Mediterranean Monk Seal (Boulva 1979, Reijnders et al. 1993). Research on organochlorine pollutants, which were analysed in the blubber of individuals collected during the 1990s from the Cabo Blanco and the subpopulation in the eastern Mediterranean, indicate that residue levels were very low in the former subpopulation and moderate to high in the latter (Yediler et al. 1993, Borrell et al. 1997, Borrell et al. 2007). More recent research efforts indicate that trace elements do not constitute a major conservation threat for Monk Seals in Greece (Formigaro et al. 2016).Mediterranean Monk Seals are at an unknown, but suspected, medium level of risk from oil spills. This results from increased tanker traffic, and a greater chance for accidents, disturbance, and collisions near important habitats. In Türkiye, at least three such accidents that have affected Monk Seals and their habitat have occurred (Kıraç 1998, Kıraç et al. 2022). In response to one of these accidents, a clean-up operation and regulatory measures were taken in Türkiye to reduce the threat from oil spills (Kıraç and Güçlüsoy 2007). Accumulation of solid waste negatively affecting suitable monk seal habitat has been recorded in Greece, Türkiye and Cyprus and has been dealt with, with clean-up operations (Dendrinos et al. 2015).The arrival of Lessepsian fishes in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, such as the toxic Silver-cheeked Toadfish (Lagocephalus sceleratus), could have a negative impact on Monk Seals in the region. This fish has been implicated in the death of at least one Monk Seal in northern Cyprus (A.C. Gücü pers. comm. November 2022).","The once abundant Mediterranean Monk Seal has disappeared from most of its historical range; the most significant declines in the Mediterranean Sea occurred during ancient and historic times (Johnson and Lavigne 1999, Johnson 2004) and along the Atlantic coasts of northwest Africa during the 14th–16th centuries when commercial exploitation of the Monk Seal colonies on open beaches took place (González 2015). Deliberate killing up until the first half of the 20th century reduced Monk Seal populations further (Karamanlidis et al. 2016a). All these significant population declines occurred more than three generations ago. Nine Important Marine Mammal Areas (IMMAs) have been identified for this species, including the Cabo Blanco IMMA, the Madeira and Desertas IMMA, and seven IMMAs in the eastern Mediterranean.Conservation measures introduced over the last 35 years have helped to stem the decline, and there is now evidence of an increase in the size of the surviving subpopulations in the Atlantic Sea, i.e., Cabo Blanco Peninsula (Ras Nouadhibou) and the Archipelago of Madeira (Pires et al. 2020, Fernández de Larrinoa et al. 2021, Pires et al. 2023), as well as a recent, significant increase in the range of the Mediterranean Monk Seal in Greece, in the eastern Mediterranean Sea (Adamantopoulou et al. 2022). However, the global population of the Mediterranean Monk Seal remains small and still faces many threats (see the 'Threats' section). The Mediterranean Monk Seal is regarded as one of the most endangered pinniped species in the world, with an estimated total global population size of fewer than 1,000 mature individuals (Karamanlidis and Dendrinos 2015, Karamanlidis et al. 2019, CBD Habitat, Department of Fisheries and Marine Research Cyprus, MOm, IFCN, SAD-AFAG unpublished data September 2023).Three subpopulations are globally recognised, two in the Atlantic Ocean and one in the Mediterranean Sea. The Atlantic Ocean subpopulations have been the subject of intensive monitoring efforts for more than 10 years that have produced accurate population size estimates: The 2021 census of the subpopulation in the Archipelago of Madeira identified 27 individuals (Pires et al. 2023). The colony in the Cabo Blanco Peninsula (Ras Nouadhibou), which is concentrated in a small area, has been estimated to number approximately 350 seals (CBD-Habitat unpublished data September 2023). The other large Monk Seal subpopulation is widely distributed, mainly throughout the eastern Mediterranean Sea (Karamanlidis and Dendrinos 2015, Karamanlidis et al. 2019). Based on population parameters from the Monk Seal subpopulations in the Cabo Blanco Peninsula (Ras Nouadhibou) (P. Fernandez de Larrinoa pers. comm. September 2023), Madeira (Pires et al. 2023), and the reproductive nuclei in Astakida (MOm 2008a) and Gyaros (Karamanlidis and Dendrinos 2012) in Greece, a minimum annual pup production in the eastern Mediterranean of 97 [i.e., Greece: 75; Türkiye: 17 (M. Ok and C.O. Kiraç pers. comm. September 2023), Cyprus: 3; Remainder: 2] and a “pup multiplier” created from the relationship between the number of pups born annually and the number of reproducing animals in a given subpopulation (A. Karamanlidis pers. comm. September 2023), the global number of mature animals is likely 444-600.",Increasing,"Monachus monachus (Mediterranean Monk Seals) were once widely and continuously distributed throughout the entire Mediterranean and Black Sea and the Archipelagos of the Canary, Madeira and Azores Islands (Karamanlidis et al. 2016a), as well as the north-western coast of Africa and the coast of the Iberian Peninsula in the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean (González 2015). Today the global distribution of the species is fragmented into three main subpopulations, one in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and two in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. In the eastern Mediterranean Sea, the most important reproductive areas of the species are at islands in the Ionian and Aegean Seas, and along the coasts of mainland Greece, Türkiye and Cyprus (Adamantopoulou et al. 1999, Güçlüsoy et al. 2004, Gücü et al. 2004, Gücü et al. 2009a, Gücü et al. 2009b, Nicolaou et al. 2019, Beton et al. 2021, Adamantopoulou et al. 2022). In the Turkish Black Sea, Mediterranean Monk Seals are believed to be extinct since 1997 (Kıraç and Savas 1996; Kıraç 2001, 2011); some individuals still survive in the Sea of Marmara (Inanmaz et al. 2014, Kıraç and Veryeri 2018). Following a number of sightings (Bundone et al. 2022) and the birth of a pup in 2019 (Eastern Adriatic Monk seal Project 2019) the species is considered to be resident now also in Albania.Sightings/occurrences of vagrant animals, most likely originating from Greece and Türkiye, are reported/assumed from throughout the Mediterranean (Karamanlidis et al. 2016a, Bundone et al. 2019): e.g., Italy (Fioravanti et al. 2020, Valsecchi et al. 2022), Montenegro and Croatia (Eastern Adriatic Monk seal Project 2019), Lebanon, Israel (Scheinin et al. 2011), Libya (Alfaghi et al. 2013), Egypt and Spain (Valsecchi et al. 2022). Mediterranean Monk Seals are considered extinct in Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cabo Verde, France, Gambia, Georgia, Malta, Monaco, Morocco, Portugal (continental part and Archipelago of Azores), Romania, Russia, Senegal, Slovenia, Spain (including the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean), Tunisia and Ukraine.In the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean Monk seals have gone extinct throughout their historical range and survive nowadays only in the Cabo Blanco Peninsula (Ras Nouadhibou) and the Archipelago of Madeira (Pires and Neves 2001, Karamanlidis et al. 2003, Karamanlidis et al. 2004, Pires et al. 2008, González 2015, Pires et al. 2020, Fernández de Larrinoa et al. 2021, Pires et al. 2023).","In the past, Mediterranean Monk Seals were hunted by humans for their fur, oil, meat, and for medicinal use. Evidence suggests that Monk Seal colonies in the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean were severely depleted during the Roman era (Johnson and Lavigne 1999, Johnson 2004), the Middle Ages (González 2015), up until the 20th century (González and Fernandez de Larrinoa 2012, Karamanlidis et al. 2016a). Today there is no commercial exploitation of the species.",Terrestrial|Marine,"The Mediterranean Monk Seal is legally protected throughout its range through numerous national laws and regional (Notarbartolo di Sciara 2013) and international treaties [e.g., the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (a.k.a. the CITES Convention), the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS or the Bonn Convention), the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (the  Bern Convention), the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)], as well as European Union (EU) regulations (e.g., Council Directive 92/43/EEC-Natura 2000 on the Conservation of Natural Habitats of Wild Fauna and Flora, and Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008, the “Marine Strategy Framework Directive”).Legislative measures and research, management, and conservation actions to effectively protect important Monk Seal populations in Greece are carried out throughout the country (Dendrinos et al. 2020), and have been supported by several EU-funded LIFE projects (e.g., “Monk seal &amp; fisheries: Mitigating the conflict in Greek seas”, LIFE05 NAT/GR/000083; “Integrated monk seal conservation in Northern Cyclades”, LIFE12 NAT/GR/000688). In Türkiye, conservation measures are carried out primarily in four provinces: İzmir, Muğla, Antalya and Mersin. In addition, five coastal locations were adopted as monk seal priority conservation zones in the country in 2004: Gökçeada, Foça-Karaburun, Alaçatı-Sıgacık, the Bodrum Peninsula, and the Cilician coasts (Kıraç et al. 2013). In Cyprus, the Mediterranean Monk Seal has been legally protected since 1971 by the Fisheries Law and Regulations. Research (i.e., including intense monitoring efforts), effective management of marine protected areas designated for the species and public awareness, are some of the conservation measures implemented to effectively protect and conserve the Monk Seal in Cyprus (Department of Fisheries and Marine Research 2022). In Madeira, legislative measures and research, management, and conservation actions to effectively protect Monk Seals and their habitat are carried out throughout the Archipelago since 1988 (Pires et al. 2020). Recent conservation efforts in the region have been supported by the LIFE “Mediterranean monk seal conservation in Madeira and development of a conservation status surveillance system” Project LIFE13NAT/ES/000974. Monk Seal habitat in the Cabo Blanco Peninsula (Ras Nouadhibou) is currently protected by several coastal and marine protected areas, as well as by ‘no take’ reserves. The local Monk Seal subpopulation has been permanently monitored and protected by an International Conservation Program since 2000.Additionally, the species is explicitly mentioned in numerous Natura 2000 sites within the countries of the EU (i.e., Greece, Cyprus and Madeira in Portugal). According to the Council’s Directive 92/43EEC ‘on the conservation of natural habitats of wild fauna and flora’ the Mediterranean Monk Seal is considered a species of community importance. Based on the above Directive, Natura 2000 sites are legally considered by EU Member States as Protected Areas. All marine caves used by Monk Seals in the Archipelago of Madeira are situated within the local Natura 2000 network (Pires et al. 2020).Throughout the range of the species, widespread action has been taken to sensitize the general public towards Monk Seal conservation, to protect pupping caves, to restrict fishing gear and relocate the most dangerous fishing practices, to develop monitoring programs and intervention protocols, and to increase on-site capability to rehabilitate sick and injured individuals, particularly pups. Numerous agreements, conventions, and treaties (on a regional, national, and international level) are in force to protect Monk Seals and many workshops and conferences have brought together scientists and managers to discuss Monk Seal conservation issues and problems. Furthermore, numerous international bodies and fora, including the Regional Activity Centre for Specially Protected Areas (SPA/RAC) and the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean, have put forward initiatives and proposals in order to ameliorate existing threats and mitigate pressures from relevant sectors (i.e., fisheries, bycatch, etc.). An International Action Plan for the recovery of the Monk Seal in the eastern Atlantic Ocean has been developed by the national authorities of Mauritania, Morocco, Portugal and Spain and has been successfully implemented over the last 20 years, thus improving the conservation status of the species in the region (González et al. 2006).In Greece, the “Action plan for the Mediterranean Monk Seal” (Dendrinos et al. 2020) describes in detail actions that should be carried out in the country until 2027 in order to safeguard the future of the species. In Türkiye, nationwide conservation and public awareness and educational efforts have been ongoing for more than three decades. Conservation activities have included the protection of critical Monk Seal habitat (i.e., including the prohibition of the illegal entering into Monk Seal caves), scientific monitoring of the species, rescue and rehabilitation of orphan, sick and wounded seals, clean-up activities in and around important Monk Seal caves and widespread awareness and educational activities in schools and fishing communities (Kıraç et al. 2013). Despite stable population trends, numerous threats to the Monk seal persist in Türkiye and the status of the species should be considered critical. Therefore, effective conservation measures for the species and its habitat remain of critical importance in Türkiye and should be pursued with vigour (C.O. Kıraç and M. Ok pers. comm. September 2023). In Cyprus, habitat restoration activities, promoting public awareness, developing and establishing a National Action Plan and a national monitoring protocol, scientific monitoring of the species and habitat protection are some of the priorities for, and conservation actions taken, to safeguard the future of the species in the country (Department of Fisheries and Marine Research 2022). Following the conservation priorities identified in the Action Plan for the recovery of the Monk Seal in the eastern Atlantic Ocean (González et al. 2006), conservation actions for Monk Seals in the Archipelago of Madeira have included, among others, the standardized, systematic monitoring of the species and its habitat, mitigating negative fishery-Monk Seal interactions, public awareness and habitat protection (Instituto das Florestas e Conservação da Natureza unpublished data September 2023). In 2020 a Strategy for the Conservation of the Mediterranean Monk Seal was approved by the Government Council of Madeira (Pires et al. 2020). Following the same priorities, conservation actions in the Cabo Blanco Peninsula (Ras Nouadhibou) have included the permanent protection and monitoring of the reproductive areas of the local Monk Seal population, the standardized, systematic monitoring of the population, the identification of critical terrestrial and marine (e.g. foraging areas) habitats, the development of a social aid program focused on artisan fishermen to improve their living and working conditions, as well as the implementation of a wide awareness and information program for local communities, fishermen and the general public.Priority conservation actions for the Mediterranean Monk Seal include: a) strengthening the legal framework for the protection of the terrestrial and marine habitat of the species, b) effective protection of the species (i.e., reduction of deliberate killing) and its terrestrial and marine habitat, c) population and habitat monitoring (including, for example, determining food availability and primary death causes), d) rescue and rehabilitation of injured, orphaned and sick individuals, e) public awareness, f) monitoring and mitigating negative seal – fishery interactions (Karamanlidis et al. 2016a), and g) expansion of the species’ current geographic range in the Atlantic Ocean (González et al. 2006).",Palearctic,,false,false,Global
